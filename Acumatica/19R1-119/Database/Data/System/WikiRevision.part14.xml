By using the service management functionality, you can effectively manage the entire lifecycle of the service orders of your company. That is, you can maintain information about the services that your company provides, the service orders and appointments, and the staff members who perform services (including their work schedules, skills, and licenses). With the automation features, reporting options, and integration with the financial, inventory, order management, and customer management functionality, the service management functional area of Acumatica ERP streamlines the entire service process. {br}

The primary features of the service management functionality are described briefly below. {br}{TOC}
==Easy Maintenance of Staff Member Details==
In Acumatica ERP, you can enter and store professional information about each employee, such as the employee&rsquo;s skills, the licenses that grant the employee permission to perform certain kinds of work, the geographical areas where the employee can work, and the employee&rsquo;s work schedules. The system provides tools that use this information to help you quickly and easily select the right person to deliver your services. For more information about these capabilities, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Managing_Employees|Managing Staff Members].
==Service Scheduling and Dispatching==
Once you get an inbound call from a customer, you can quickly capture service needs and access customer, history, and resource information to shorten the time between the receipt of this call and the assignment of the service. By using the calendar boards, you can match services to the best available resources and schedule appointments; if required, you can also generate work orders. You can manage daily or weekly schedules automatically or manually, depending on your business needs. The scheduling functionality is described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Scheduling|Appointment Scheduling Options].
==Flexible Billing Settings==
In Field Services functional area of Acumatica ERP, invoice generation is based on billing cycles, so you can select different options for billing of different customers. You can assign a customer one billing cycle to generate documents with the same level of information for each service order, or you can specify multiple billing cycles for a customer to generate different documents for different types of service orders. Details on billing cycles are described in the following topics:[anchor|#_7d819424-a3a0-453d-922f-6186345b983d]
*[HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Billing_Cycle|Billing Cycle Settings]
*[HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Billing_Cycles_Examples|Examples of Billing Cycles]

==Integration with Other Areas==
You can process the sales of stock items and services performed on the sold items together, to effectively manage services without reentering pricing and discount information. You create a sales order with services and process the work on services in the Service Management functional area. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_SO_Integration|Integration of Sales Orders and Service Orders].{br}

If a service order requires parts that are not in inventory, you can direct the system to create a purchase order and indicate parts as waiting for delivery. Once the parts are received, the service order will be updated automatically and appointments can be created for the service order. {br}

In the following figure, you can see the flow of documents in the Service Management module.[anchor|#_367e0cb3-a122-4b96-95df-21e788767340][anchor|#_9a5feb82-4ea0-4330-8297-8b9223c62b2f][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Document_Flow_SM.png|popup|Document flow in Service Management|450px]
==Integration with the Equipment Management==
In Acumatica ERP, you can easily manage and store information on the equipment used for service orders as well as track all information about equipment that needs to be serviced and equipment that can be used for providing services. You can select the equipment by the type needed for the service and assign the equipment to a service order if necessary, and you can track information on equipment, including appointments where it was used. 
==Other Features and Options==
*Service defaults and overrides
*Parts and inventory management
*Route management integration 
*Customer management integration
*Bing Maps integration
*Mobile service management (Android and iOS)

This topic covers the prerequisites and the preparatory steps you should perform before you begin configuring the Service Management module.
==Prerequisites and Dependencies==
The initial system configuration must be completed and the General Ledger module must be configured before you implement the Service Management module. The Service Management module can be tightly integrated with the following Acumatica ERP modules: Accounts Payable, Account Receivable, Sales Orders, and Customer Management. These modules do not require any change in their configuration when the Service Management module is implemented; however, the modules to be integrated with the Service Management module should be implemented first.
==Preparation==
This section covers the needed preparation before you begin the basic configuration of the Service Management module. {br}

Preparation for the basic configuration consists primarily of researching how your company will manage the service appointments and where and how the invoices will be generated to customers for the service delivery. You will also gather other service-related information and review settings on various system forms. [anchor|#_3996ac19-230d-4a1b-a7c0-4a13634e1353]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Action
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| '''Define auto-numbering sequences'''
| Develop numbering rules (which will later determine how the auto-numbering sequences are configured) for the following entities: [anchor|#_a8723481-eaf1-4356-ac47-3d3c579b81c3]
*Service orders
*Staff schedules 
*Posting batches 
*Equipment (if needed)
*Licenses (if needed)

|- 
| '''Review accounts and subaccounts'''
| Analyze the transaction processing and reporting of the Service Management module, review the existing accounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form and subaccounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_30_00|Subaccounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL203000|GL203000]) form (if subaccounts are used in your company), and prepare a list of accounts and subaccounts to add.
|- 
| '''Decide on the work calendars'''
| Determine which work calendar will be used in your organization for service management. For each calendar to be used, write down the following information:[anchor|#_42c29d72-08ba-4a2e-ba43-9745e7dde532]
*Calendar ID and description
*Work hours during each week
*Time zone
*Exceptions (exceptions to the normal work hours, such as holidays)

|- 
| '''Identify branch locations'''
| Identify the branch locations, which are subdivisions of company branches. Branch locations represent different physical locations from which a staff member may depart to go to appointments. For each branch location, write down the following information: [anchor|#_c1f95bc3-444e-4faf-8bdd-a1aecc9ad1e9]
* Contact information of the branch location (such as email address and phone and fax numbers) and address 
* Branch 
* Subaccount, if applicable 
* Default warehouse (where the equipment for the services can be stored) and default unit of measure for the equipment

|- 
| '''Identify billing cycles for each customer'''
| Make a list of the billing cycles that will be used for each customer. Identify whether one customer can have different billing cycles based on the type of service performed. For instance, appointments for installation can be billed by service orders, while appointments related to periodic service calls from a customer can be billed at the end of the month. For examples of different scenarios of service provision, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Possible_Scenarios|Service Management Use Cases]. Do the following for each listed billing cycle: [anchor|#_07e5fbca-0d5c-4163-95c1-bb7dd6eddeb1]
* Decide which of the following invoice options to use: 
**''Generate Invoices from Appointments'': The appointment has to be attended for the invoice to be generated, and the invoice will be based on the specifics of the actual appointment. 
**''Generate Invoices from Service Orders'': The appointment does not necessarily have to happen for the invoice to be generated, and changes in the appointments (such as a service that took more time than was estimated) will not be reflected in the invoice. 
* Decide which of the following invoice grouping options to use:
**''Appointment'': The system will generate a single invoice for each appointment. The invoices will not be grouped.
**''Service Order'': The system will generate a single invoice for each service order.
**''Work Order'': The system will generate a single invoice for each customer work order.
**''Purchase Order'': The system will generate a single invoice for each purchase order.
**''Time Frame'': The system will generate a single invoice for each particular period of time (for instance, every week or at the end of the month).
*:Additionally, decide if you are going to create separate invoices for each customer location.

For details on billing cycles, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Billing_Cycle|Billing Cycle Settings].
|- 
| '''Decide which service order types your company will use'''
| 
Decide which service order types you want to define for different types of appointments, invoicing settings, and customer settings. If multiple billing cycles are applicable to one customer, each billing cycle option should have a different service order type (for instance, one service order type for installation and another for reactive calls). For examples of different scenarios, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Possible_Scenarios|Service Management Use Cases].{br}

Make a list with the following standard information for each service order type:[anchor|#_0dcfc10f-e290-41d4-b4a2-d8f09be29285]
* Service order type ID and description
* Behavior: 
**''Quote'': An agreement to provide a service with a specified price to a customer in the future.
**''Internal'': An appointment within your company that doesn&rsquo;t involve a customer.
**''Regular'': An appointment to provide a service to a customer.
* The place the appointment will occur:
**In the customer location
**In the location of the customer&rsquo;s contact
**Inside your company
* If the invoice is generated, the module through which it will be performed: 
**''Accounts Receivable'': You can manage receivables and automate customer invoicing and payment collection.
**''Sales Orders'': You can create shipments and add additional freight costs.
* If the invoice is created in the Accounts Receivable module, the document to be created for invoices with negative balances: a credit memo in the Accounts Receivable module, or a bill in the Accounts Payable module
* The default credit terms, to be used if credit terms are not defined for the customer
* An indicator of whether the sales account details are taken from the customer or vendor location, warehouse, posting class, or inventory item
* If subaccounts are configured in your system, the sources of the sales subaccount segments (which can be any of the following) and their combinations:
** A: The subaccount associated with the branch location. 
** C: The subaccount associated with the branch. 
** I: The subaccount associated with the inventory item. 
** L: The subaccount associated with the customer location. 
** T: The subaccount associated with the service order type. 
* If subaccounts are configured in your system, the default subaccount of the service order type
* An indicator of whether the invoicing requires the document to be closed (by the accounting department after it reviews the completed document) or just completed (by the technician)

|- 
| '''Plan the staff members'''
| List all the employees and vendors (in separate lists) that will perform services in the appointments. For each employee, gather the following information: [anchor|#_d16ee40b-302d-4cf2-b33c-c62946b7cdb6]
* Start and end date of the employee contract
* Available days and working hours 

|- 
| '''Plan the services to be included in the Service Management module'''
| List all the services that will be performed in the Service Management module, and gather the following information for each service: [anchor|#_aebb2584-bff6-4018-8221-aeb02a10db13]
* Default billing rule (based on the time spent or a flat rate; no default rule can be used)
* Unit of measure (for example, hour if you want to customers to pay per hour of service)
* Sales account (and sales subaccount, if subaccounts are used in your system) 
* Price information 
* Tax category (if integration with Avalara is not configured)
*Warehouse (if equipment may be needed to perform these services)

According to the gathered information, divide the services into the service classes, each of which will have settings common to the services of the class. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Classes|Service Classes].
|- 
| '''Gather information on the applicable skills and licenses'''
| To take advantage of the Service Management module&rsquo;s options that help you ensure that the right staff member performs each service, identify whether your company uses each of the following to match services and staff members: [anchor|#_c55e004c-70af-4bf9-bc22-4e7651e7f34e]
* Skills (see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_skills|Skills]): If these are applicable for your company, gather the following information:
** List of skills 
** Employees who perform each skill
** Needed skills to perform each service 
* Licenses (see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_licences|Licenses]): If these are applicable for your company, gather the following information: 
** List of license types and locations where licenses of each type are applicable 
** List of licenses for each employee, including the following details: 
*** Issue and expiration date 
*** Agency 
** Needed licenses to perform each service

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Prerequisites and Preparation This topic covers the prerequisites and the preparatory steps you should perform before you       begin configuring the Service Management module. Prerequisites and Dependencies The initial system configuration must be completed and the General Ledger module must be         configured before you implement the Service Management module. The Service Management module         can be tightly integrated with the following  Acumatica ERP modules: Accounts         Payable, Account Receivable, Sales Orders, and Customer Management. These modules do not         require any change in their configuration when the Service Management module is implemented;         however, the modules to be integrated with the Service Management module should be         implemented first. Preparation This section covers the needed preparation before you begin the basic configuration of the         Service Management module.  Preparation for the basic configuration consists primarily of researching how your company         will manage the service appointments and where and how the invoices will be generated to         customers for the service delivery. You will also gather other service-related information         and review settings on various system forms.  Action Description Define auto-numbering sequences Develop numbering rules (which will later determine how the auto-numbering sequences                 are configured) for the following entities:  Service orders Staff schedules  Posting batches  Equipment (if needed) Licenses (if needed) Review  accounts and subaccounts Analyze the transaction processing and reporting of the Service Management module,                 review the existing accounts on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) Chart of Accounts (GL202500)                 form and subaccounts on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL203000|GL203000]) Subaccounts (GL203000) form (if                 subaccounts are used in your company), and prepare a list of accounts and                 subaccounts to add. Decide on the work calendars Determine which work calendar will be used in your organization for service                 management. For each calendar to be used, write down the following information: Calendar ID and description Work hours during each week Time zone Exceptions (exceptions to the normal work hours, such as holidays) Identify branch locations Identify the branch locations, which are subdivisions of company branches. Branch                 locations represent different physical locations from which a staff member may                 depart to go to appointments. For each branch location, write down the following                 information:   Contact information of the branch location (such as email address and phone                     and fax numbers) and address   Branch   Subaccount, if applicable   Default warehouse (where the equipment for the services can be stored) and                     default unit of measure for the equipment Identify billing cycles for each customer Make a list of the billing cycles that will be used for each customer. Identify                 whether one customer can have different billing cycles based on the type of service                 performed. For instance, appointments for installation can be billed by service                 orders, while appointments related to periodic service calls from a customer can be                 billed at the end of the month. For examples of different scenarios of service                 provision, see  Service Management Use Cases. Do the following for                 each listed billing cycle:   Decide which of the following invoice options to use:  Generate Invoices from Appointments : The appointment has to be                         attended for the invoice to be generated, and the invoice will be based on                         the specifics of the actual appointment.  Generate Invoices from Service Orders : The appointment does not                         necessarily have to happen for the invoice to be generated, and changes in                         the appointments (such as a service that took more time than was estimated)                         will not be reflected in the invoice.   Decide which of the following invoice grouping options to use: Appointment : The system will generate a single invoice for each                         appointment. The invoices will not be grouped. Service Order : The system will generate a single invoice for each                         service order. Work Order : The system will generate a single invoice for each                         customer work order. Purchase Order : The system will generate a single invoice for each                         purchase order. Time Frame : The system will generate a single invoice for each                         particular period of time (for instance, every week or at the end of the                         month). Additionally, decide if you are going to create separate invoices for                       each customer location. For details on billing cycles, see  Billing Cycle Settings. Decide which service order types your company will use Decide which service order types you want to define for different types of                   appointments, invoicing settings, and customer settings. If multiple billing                   cycles are applicable to one customer, each billing cycle option should have a                   different service order type (for instance, one service order type for                   installation and another for reactive calls). For examples of different scenarios,                   see  Service Management Use Cases. Make a list with the following standard information for each service order                   type:  Service order type ID and description  Behavior:  Quote : An agreement to provide a service with a specified price to                         a customer in the future. Internal : An appointment within your company that doesn't involve a                         customer. Regular : An appointment to provide a service to a customer.  The place the appointment will occur: In the customer location In the location of the customer's contact Inside your company  If the invoice is generated, the module through which it will be performed:                        Accounts Receivable : You can manage receivables and automate                         customer invoicing and payment collection. Sales Orders : You can create shipments and add additional freight                         costs.  If the invoice is created in the Accounts Receivable module, the document to                     be created for invoices with negative balances: a credit memo in the Accounts                     Receivable module, or a bill in the Accounts Payable module  The default credit terms, to be used if credit terms are not defined for the                     customer  An indicator of whether the sales account details are taken from the customer                     or vendor location, warehouse, posting class, or inventory item  If subaccounts are configured in your system, the sources of the sales                     subaccount segments (which can be any of the following) and their                       combinations:  A: The subaccount associated with the branch location.                           C: The subaccount associated with the branch.                           I: The subaccount associated with the inventory item.                           L: The subaccount associated with the customer location.                           T: The subaccount associated with the service order type.                           If subaccounts are configured in your system, the default subaccount of the                     service order type  An indicator of whether the invoicing requires the document to be closed (by                     the accounting department after it reviews the completed document) or just                     completed (by the technician) Plan the staff members List all the employees and vendors (in separate lists) that will perform services in                 the appointments. For each employee, gather the following information:   Start and end date of the employee contract  Available days and working hours  Plan the services to be included in the Service Management module List all the services that will be performed in the Service Management module, and                 gather the following information for each service:   Default billing rule (based on the time spent or a flat rate; no default rule                     can be used)  Unit of measure (for example, hour if you want to customers to pay per hour                     of service)  Sales account (and sales subaccount, if subaccounts are used in your system)   Price information   Tax category (if integration with Avalara is not configured) Warehouse (if equipment may be needed to perform these services) According to the gathered information, divide the services into the service                   classes, each of which will have settings common to the services of the class. For                   details, see  Service Classes. Gather information on the applicable skills and licenses To take advantage of the Service Management module's options that help you ensure that                 the right staff member performs each service, identify whether your company uses                 each of the following to match services and staff members:   Skills (see  Skills): If these are applicable for                     your company, gather the following information:  List of skills   Employees who perform each skill  Needed skills to perform each service   Licenses (see  Licenses): If these are applicable                     for your company, gather the following information:   List of license types and locations where licenses of each type are                         applicable   List of licenses for each employee, including the following details:   Issue and expiration date   Agency   Needed licenses to perform each service   Service areas (see  Service Areas): These are                     the areas where the employee can perform a service.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Configuration Flow This topic describes the process of configuring the basic functionality of the Service         Management module, based on the information you have compiled during preparation. Due to         dependencies among the forms, the sequence of actions during configuration is critical, so         please note instructions about the order in which the steps should be performed.  No. Action Description 1 Define auto-numbering sequences Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences                 (CS201010) form to create new numbering sequences for the following:   Service orders  Employee schedules   Posting batches   Equipment (if needed)  Licenses (if needed) 2 Create General Ledger accounts Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) Chart of Accounts                 (GL202500) form to add any needed General Ledger accounts identified during                 preparation. For details, see  To Add an Account to the Chart of Accounts. 3 Create subaccount segment values Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) Segment Values (CS203000) form in the                 Common Settings module to enter the allowed values for segments of the subaccounts.                    This step is necessary if you use subaccounts in your company and the                      Subaccount  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features                   (CS100000) form.  4 Create General Ledger subaccounts Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL203000|GL203000]) Subaccounts                 (GL203000) form to create subaccounts if they are used in your company.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, service order types are used to define the general settings for service orders and appointments associated with the particular type.{br}

In this topic, you will read about creating service order types and specifying their main settings during creation.{br}{TOC}
==Creating a Service Order Type==
You create a service order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form. For each service order type, you specify the following:[anchor|#ul_jsy_jsd_ky]
*The numbering sequence to be used for the reference numbers of orders of the type
*The behavior of the type, which determines the availability of certain form elements for service orders and appointments of the type
*General settings
*Default settings of service orders and appointments of the type
*Billing settings (that is, the settings related to billing customers for service orders of the type)
*Settings that affect integration between appointments of the type and forms in the system that track the time that staff members spend on attending appointments or performing services 
{br}

These types of settings are described in the sections of this topic. You can specify additional settings for the service order type, such as problem codes, attributes, mailing settings, and time preferences for the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form for appointments of this type. Also, you can configure quick processing for the service order type so that users can process the service orders and appointments of this type with just one click. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Configuration_of_QP|Configuration of Quick Processing].
==Selecting a Behavior==
Depending on the behavior you select for the service order type, the system makes particular boxes and tabs available or unavailable on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types], [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) forms. You can select one of the following behaviors for the service order type:[anchor|#_083da7eb-657a-4155-a041-16a5293c24f4]
*''Regular'': You select this behavior if service orders of the type will include the usual services, such as repair, maintenance, installation, and training. For this behavior, you can set up all the settings except the route-related settings.
*''Route'': You select this behavior if service orders of the type include details of the route between locations where services are performed. For the service order types with this behavior, the route can be specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. For details on routes, see the [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Routes|Managing Routes] chapter in the Route Management guide.
*''Internal'': You select this behavior for a type that includes service orders of your own company, and appointments take place inside the company. Because there is no customer involved with the service orders of the type with this behavior, the posting, customer, and route settings are unavailable for the service orders of this type.
*''Quote'': You select this behavior a type designed for quotes (which can be converted into service orders if the customer agrees to the quote). For types with this behavior, posting settings are unavailable on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] form.

==Specifying the Default Settings==
For appointments of the service order type, you can define the default source of the address for the appointment, which is specified in documents related to the appointment. In the '''Default Settings''' section on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] form, in the '''Take Address and Contact Information From''' box, you select one of the following options:[anchor|#_a96e68df-5487-4c59-ad51-d24c58015b2a]
*''Business Account'': Select this button when the appointments of the type generally take place at the main address—that is, the address that is specified in the '''Main Address''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form.
*''Contact'': Select this button when the appointments of the type generally take place at the address of the customer&rsquo;s contact person—that is, at the address that is specified in the '''Address''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form.
*''Branch Location'': Select this button when the appointments of this type generally take place at the address of your branch location—that is, at the address that is specified for the branch location in the '''Main Address''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_25_00|Branch Locations] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202500|FS202500]) form.
{br}

Also, in the '''Default Settings''' section, you can specify a salesperson that will be assigned by default to the service orders and appointments of the type and whether the commission is paid to this salesperson or not.
==Specifying the Invoice Generation Settings==
The invoice generation settings define the type of the documents for customer billing that are generated for appointments or service orders of the service order type, and the general settings for these documents. You specify these settings in the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section of the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] form. You select the billing document as follows:[anchor|#_85611c6e-0ddd-4201-8948-4c12cfe2f075]
*If you need to generate a billing document for services (of the service order type) only, you select the '''Accounts Receivable''' option button under '''Generate Invoices In'''. With this option selected, the system generates an accounts receivable invoice when a user invokes document generation for a service order or appointment. The invoice can then be processed and the payment collected.
*:If the '''Create a Bill Document in AP for Negative Balances''' check box (which is available if you select this option button) is selected, for the service order or appointment with a negative balance, the system instead creates an accounts payable bill.
*If you need to generate a billing document for both services (of the service order type) and inventory items (which may involve shipping) that were sold to customers along with the services, you select the '''Sales Orders''' option button under '''Generate Invoices In'''. With this option selected, the system initially generates a sales order when a user invokes invoice generation. Optionally, you can create shipments and add freight costs for the sales order. You then generate the invoice. If you have configured quick processing for the service order type, the invoice can be generated automatically along with the sales order. For details about quick processing, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Quick_Processing_Workflow|Quick Processing of Service Orders and Appointments].
*:((({S:Hint}Integration with field services has to be enabled for the sales order type so that you can generate sales orders from forms related to field services. That is, the '''Enable Field Services Integration''' check box has to be selected for the necessary order type on the '''General Settings '''tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.
)))
*If you need to generate a billing document for both services (of the service order type) and inventory items (which do not involve shipping) that were sold to customers along with the services, you select the '''SO Invoice''' option button under '''Generate Invoices In'''. With this option selected, the system initially generates an SO invoice when a user invokes invoice generation. If you have configured quick processing for the service order type, the invoice can be processed automatically in the system. 
*If you do not need to generate invoices for the customer for services of the service order type, you select the '''None''' option button under '''Generate Invoices In''' group.
{br}

When you have selected the option button, you specify the default settings for it (also in the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section) to be used in the invoice documents. 
==Setting Up the Time & Expenses Integration==
In the '''Time & Expenses Integration''' section of the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, you can set up integration with the forms on which time activities are tracked for the service order type if the '''Enable Time & Expenses Integration''' check box is selected in the '''Integrating with Time & Expenses''' section on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form. You need to select the '''Require Time Approval to Close Appointments''' check box if you want to set up approval (by an employee with this responsibility) of the time spent performing services of the type. {br}

In this section, you can also select the '''Automatically Create Time Activities from Appointments''' check box to set up the automatic creation of time activities; you have to also specify the default earning type for the time activities. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Integration_TimeExpenses|Integration with Time & Expenses]. [anchor|#_27957a1a-ff98-4359-88b0-ff600f3387d0]
==Specifying Attributes for Service Orders, Appointments, and Service Contract Schedules==
An attribute is a site-defined property (for instance, industry or problem type) that gives users the ability to specify information for objects in the system beyond the preconfigured settings on the data entry forms. In the settings of a service order type, you can specify attributes for the classification of service orders, appointments, and service schedules. The applicable set of attributes is specified for a particular service order type on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form. {br}

On this tab, you can select attributes only if they have already been defined in the system. If you need an attribute that has not been defined in the system, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form to create the attribute. Then you will be able to select the new attribute for any service order type.{br}

The attributes you specify on this tab will be listed for service orders and appointments of this service order type on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) forms, respectively. The system also copies the active attributes on this tab to the service schedules of this service order type on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) forms. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] form, you can specify whether each attribute of the service order type is required. When creating a service order, appointment, or service schedule of the service order type, the user must specify values for all the required attributes. Also, you can specify default values for any attributes of the type; users can overwrite these values for a particular service order, appointment, or service schedule of the type.{br}

You can deactivate an obsolete attribute for service orders and appointments of a particular type by clearing the '''Active''' check box on this tab. If you do, the deactivated attribute will no longer be displayed for the service orders, appointments, and service schedules of the type, but all attribute values that have already been specified for existing service orders, appointments, and service schedules will still be stored in the database. If you re-activate the attribute, its values (where specified) will become visible in the system again. {br}

However, if it is not necessary to preserve the data related to an obsolete attribute, you can deactivate the attribute and then delete it by using the '''Delete Row''' button on the table toolbar. In this case, the attribute will be permanently deleted from the service order type, and all attribute values will be deleted from the database.

You can specify         additional settings for the service order type, such as problem codes, attributes, mailing         settings, and time preferences for the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form for         appointments of this type. Also, you can configure quick processing for the service order         type so that users can process the service orders and appointments of this type with just         one click. For details, see  Configuration of Quick Processing. Selecting a Behavior Depending on the behavior you select for the service order type, the system makes         particular boxes and tabs available or unavailable on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types,             ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100), and   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200)         forms. You can select one of the following behaviors for the service order type: Regular : You select this behavior if service orders of the type will include             the usual services, such as repair, maintenance, installation, and training. For this             behavior, you can set up all the settings except the route-related settings. Route : You select this behavior if service orders of the type include details             of the route between locations where services are performed. For the service order types             with this behavior,              the             route can be specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form. For details on             routes, see the  Managing Routes chapter in the Route Management             guide. Internal : You select this behavior for a type that includes service orders of             your own company, and appointments take place inside the company. Because there is no             customer involved with the service orders of the type with this behavior, the posting,             customer, and route settings are unavailable for the service orders of this type. Quote : You select this behavior a type designed for quotes (which can be             converted into service orders if the customer agrees to the quote). For types with this             behavior, posting settings are unavailable on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types             form. Specifying the Default Settings For appointments of the service order type, you can define the default source of the         address for the appointment, which is specified in documents related to the appointment. In         the  Default Settings  section on the            Preferences  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types form, in the            Take Address and Contact Information From  box, you select one of         the following options: Business Account : Select this button when the appointments of the type             generally take place at the main address—that is, the address that is specified in the                Main Address  section on the  General Info              tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. Contact : Select this button when the appointments of the type generally take             place at the address of the customer's contact person—that is, at the address that is             specified in the  Address  section on the  General               Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form. Branch Location : Select this button when the appointments of this type             generally take place at the address of your branch location—that is, at the address that             is specified for the branch location in the  Main Address  section             of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202500|FS202500]) Branch Locations (FS202500) form. Also, in the  Default Settings  section, you can specify a salesperson         that will be assigned by default to the service orders and appointments of the type and         whether the commission is paid to this salesperson or not. Specifying the Invoice Generation Settings The invoice generation settings define the type of the documents for customer billing that         are generated for appointments or service orders of the service order type, and the general         settings for these documents. You specify these settings in the  Invoice           Generation Settings  section of the  Preferences  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types form. You select the billing document as follows: If you need to generate a billing document for services (of the service order type)             only, you select the  Accounts Receivable  option button under                Generate Invoices In . With this option selected, the system             generates an accounts receivable invoice when a user invokes document generation for a             service order or appointment. The invoice can then be processed and the payment               collected. If the  Create a Bill Document in AP for Negative                 Balances  check box (which is available if you select this option button)               is selected, for the service order or appointment with a negative balance, the system               instead creates an accounts payable bill. If you need to generate a billing document for both services (of the service order             type) and inventory items (which may involve shipping) that were sold to customers along             with the services, you select the  Sales Orders  option button             under  Generate Invoices In . With this option selected, the system             initially generates a sales order when a user invokes invoice generation. Optionally,             you can create shipments and add freight costs for the sales order. You then generate             the invoice. If you have configured quick processing for the service order type, the             invoice can be generated automatically along with the sales order. For details about             quick processing, see  Quick Processing of Service Orders and Appointments. Integration with field services has to be enabled for the sales order type so               that you can generate sales orders from forms related to field services. That is, the                  Enable Field Services Integration  check box has to be               selected for the necessary order type on the  General Settings                tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. If you need to generate a billing document for both services (of the service order             type) and inventory items (which do not involve shipping) that were sold to customers             along with the services, you select the  SO Invoice  option button             under  Generate Invoices In . With this option selected, the system             initially generates an SO invoice when a user invokes invoice generation. If you have             configured quick processing for the service order type, the invoice can be processed             automatically in the system.  If you do not need to generate invoices for the customer for services of the service             order type, you select the  None  option button under                Generate Invoices In  group. When you have selected the option button, you specify the default settings for it (also in         the  Invoice Generation Settings  section) to be used in the invoice         documents.  Setting Up the Time & Expenses Integration In the  Time & Expenses Integration  section of the            Preferences  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300)         form, you can set up integration with the forms on which time activities are tracked for the         service order type if the  Enable Time & Expenses Integration          check box is selected in the  Integrating with Time & Expenses          section on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form. You need to select the  Require Time           Approval to Close Appointments  check box if you want to set up approval (by an         employee with this responsibility) of the time spent performing services of the type.  In this section, you can also select the  Automatically Create Time Activities           from Appointments  check box to set up the automatic creation of time         activities; you have to also specify the default earning type for the time activities. For         details, see  Integration with Time & Expenses.  Specifying Attributes for Service Orders, Appointments, and Service Contract         Schedules An attribute is a site-defined property (for instance, industry or problem type) that gives         users the ability to specify information for objects in the system beyond the preconfigured         settings on the data entry forms. In the settings of a service order type, you can specify         attributes for the classification of service orders, appointments, and service schedules.         The applicable set of attributes is specified for a particular service order type on the            Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300)         form.  On this tab, you can select attributes only if they have already been defined in the         system. If you need an attribute that has not been defined in the system, you can use the             ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes (CS205000) form to create the attribute.         Then you will be able to select the new attribute for any service order type. The attributes you specify on this tab will be listed for service orders and appointments         of this service order type on the  Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) and   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) forms,         respectively. The system also copies the active attributes on this tab to the service         schedules of this service order type on the  Attributes  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) Service Contract Schedules (FS305100) and   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) Route Service Contract Schedules (FS305600)         forms.  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types form, you can specify whether each attribute of the         service order type is required. When creating a service order, appointment, or service         schedule of the service order type, the user must specify values for all the required         attributes. Also, you can specify default values for any attributes of the type; users can         overwrite these values for a particular service order, appointment, or service schedule of         the type. You can deactivate an obsolete attribute for service orders and appointments of a         particular type by clearing the  Active  check box on this tab. If you         do, the deactivated attribute will no longer be displayed for the service orders,         appointments, and service schedules of the type, but all attribute values that have already         been specified for existing service orders, appointments, and service schedules will still         be stored in the database. If you re-activate the attribute, its values (where specified)         will become visible in the system again.  However, if it is not necessary to preserve the data related to an obsolete attribute, you         can deactivate the attribute and then delete it by using the  Delete           Row  button on the table toolbar. In this case, the attribute will be         permanently deleted from the service order type, and all attribute values will be deleted         from the database.

==Configuring Quick Processing for a Service Order Type==
For quick processing to be used for service orders and appointments of a particular service order type, you must allow quick processing for this service order type and specify the actions to be performed during quick processing. To allow quick processing for the service order type, you select the '''Allow Quick Process''' check box on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form. This causes the '''Quick Process Settings''' tab to appear on the form. On this tab, you configure the set of processing actions to be used by default for service orders and appointments of this type. {br}

For each particular service order or appointment of the type being processed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, the list of actions to be performed can be changed. For instructions on configuring an order type for quick processing, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Configur_Quick_Processing|To Configure Quick Processing for a Service Order Type].((({S:Hint}Quick processing can be configured for service order types that are defined to initially generate sales orders from service orders or appointments (that is, the '''Sales Orders''' option button is selected in the '''Generate Invoices From''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] form). 
)))
Also, the service order lines that are marked for purchasing—that is, those with the '''Mark for PO''' check box selected on the '''Services''' or '''Inventory Item''' tab or both of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form—are excluded from quick processing because the creation of a purchase order is not included in the quick processing configuration flow.

A staff member is a person who is responsible for delivering the services that your company offers to customers. Acumatica ERP provides you with ability to create, store, and manage information about staff members that helps you to select the correct staff member to perform a particular service. This information includes the relevant skills, licenses and certifications, location, and work schedule.{br}

In this topic, you will read about staff member types, the process of staff management, the creation of staff member data, and the ways you can monitor the staff members available for performing services.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_e97e4ef1-9014-4421-9a3b-e94b2c2e9504]
==Understanding Staff Member Types==
You can create, keep, and manage information about staff members of the following types:[anchor|#_815bc7ec-a75a-41bd-b46d-b978323c712a]
*''Employee'': A staff member of this type is an employee of your company. You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form to add, view, and edit an account for a staff member of this type.
*''Vendor'': A staff member of this type is a third party that your company engages to perform services. You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) form to add, view, and edit an account for a staff member.
{br}

In Acumatica ERP, to create a list of staff members, you can enable existing employees or vendors as staff members, or create new employees or vendors that are enabled as staff members. You can view the list of staff members enabled in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_55_00|Staff] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205500|FS205500]) form.
==Understanding the Staff Configuration Process==
To manage staff members in the system, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_f8e2bc9f-fa71-4456-932e-86cd27fdcf91]
#Create a business account of the ''Employee'' or ''Vendor'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form, respectively.
#Enable the staff member account in the system.
#Optional: Enable notifications about appointments for staff members.
#Set up a work schedule.
#Specify skills and licenses for the staff member, if necessary.
#Specify service areas for the staff member, if necessary.

==Entering Employee or Vendor Data==
If your organization has only a small number of employees that are staff members, you can enter the employee data manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form. For a larger number of employees, you can create an import scenario and upload the data from a file. For details on import scenarios, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Simplified_Import_Scenarios|Simplified Scenarios for Data Import].{br}

You can add a new staff member account of the ''Employee'' type by clicking the '''Add Employee''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_55_00|Staff] form and entering the employee information on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form (which the system opens).{br}

If your organization works with only a small number of vendors that provide services as staff members, you can enter the vendor data manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form. For a larger number of vendors, you can create an import scenario and upload the data from a file.{br}

You can create a new staff member of the ''Vendor'' type by clicking the '''Add Vendor''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_55_00|Staff] form, entering the appropriate vendor information on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form (which the system opens)
==Enabling a Staff Member Account==
While you are entering the necessary employees and vendors (or at any later time), you have to enable them for use with the field services functionality as staff members. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form, you can enable the selected employee as a staff member by selecting the '''Staff Member in Service Management''' check box in the '''Service Management''' section of the form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form, you can enable the selected vendor as a staff member by selecting the '''Staff Member in Service Management''' check box in the '''Service Management''' section of the form.{br}

For each enabled staff member account, you set up the work schedule when the staff member is available for service, and you can specify the staff member&rsquo;s skills, licenses, certifications, and service areas, so the person can be selected appropriately to services.
==Setting Up the Available Work Schedule==
You can define the times when each staff member is available to provide services. You first define a staff schedule rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_20_01|Staff Schedule Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202001|FS202001]) form and then generate a schedule for a specific period of time on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_04_00|Generate Staff Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500400|FS500400]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_staff_schedule_rule|Staff Schedules].{br}

After you generate staff schedules, you can use the calendar boards to assign staff members to appointments or service orders that take place in time periods when the staff member is available for work. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Scheduling|Appointment Scheduling Options].((({S:Hint}You can create rules for staff members of the ''Employee'' type only.
)))
==Specifying Skills and Licenses==
If the services that your company offers require special credentials, you should specify the skills and licenses each staff member has. Before you start assigning skills and licenses to staff members, you should make a list of the required skills and license types, and enter them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_06_00|Skills] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200600|FS200600]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_09_00|License Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200900|FS200900]) forms, respectively. Then you can assign the needed skills when you configure a staff member on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form. For details on skills, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_skills|Skills].{br}

You can assign needed licenses to a specific staff member directly when you create a new license on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_10_00|Licenses] form, or assign licenses to the staff member on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form. For details on licenses, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_licences|Licenses].((({S:Hint}You can assign skills and licenses to staff members of the ''Employee'' type only.
)))
==Specifying Service Areas==
You can divide the area where your company offers services into multiple service areas that are defined by ZIP codes. In this case, if a staff member can provide services only in specific service areas, you assign these service areas to this staff member on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_19_00|Service Areas] ([~/?ScreenId=FS201900|FS201900]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_geographical_zones|Service Areas].((({S:Hint}You can assign service areas to the staff members of the ''Employee'' type only.
)))
==Enabling Notifications for Staff Members==
For each employee or vendor that you have set up as a staff member, you can select the '''Allow Appointment Notifications''' check box on the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_30_00|Vendors] form. With this setting, when a responsible person enters or changes details in an appointment, he or she can send an email notification to the applicable employee or vendor.
==Viewing Staff Members Defined in the System==
You can view the list of all the staff members that are defined in the system, along with basic information about each staff member, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_55_00|Staff] form. This form displays the following information about the staff members: staff member ID, name, type, branch, email address, and phone number.

In this case, if a staff member can provide services only in         specific service areas, you assign these service areas to this staff member on the             ([~/?ScreenId=FS201900|FS201900]) Service Areas (FS201900) or   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees         (EP203000) form. For details, see  Service Areas. You can assign service areas to the staff members of the  Employee  type         only. Enabling Notifications for Staff Members For each employee or vendor that you have set up as a staff member, you can select the            Allow Appointment Notifications  check box on the Summary area of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees or   ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) Vendors form. With this         setting, when a responsible person enters or changes details in an appointment, he or she         can send an email notification to the applicable employee or vendor. Viewing Staff Members Defined in the System You can view the list of all the staff members that are defined in the system, along with         basic information about each staff member, by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205500|FS205500]) Staff         form. This form displays the following information about the staff members: staff member ID,         name, type, branch, email address, and phone number.  ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS201900|FS201900])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS201000|FS201000])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS205500|FS205500])  ([~/?ScreenId=AP303000|AP303000]) ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP offers multiple options to help you ensure that the right staff member of your company performs each service. That is, if the staff member needs to have special skills or knowledge to perform a particular service, the system automatically suggests to you the list of staff members with the specific skills or licenses required for your service.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how skills are created in the system and then assigned to a staff member and to a service.
==Creating a List of Skills==
Before you start creating a list of all the skills to be used for services by your company, you should gather information about the skills that are required for all of the services your company is going to perform. You then create the list of all required skills for performing services on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_06_00|Skills] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200600|FS200600]) form. 
==Assigning Skills to Staff Members and Services==
Now that you have created in the system the list of all skills that may be needed for performing services, you need to assign the needed skills to appropriate staff members and to particular services. To assign skills to a particular staff member, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form, you first select the appropriate staff member account. Then on the '''Skills''' tab, you add a row for each skill the employee has. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_assign_skills|To Assign Skills].((({S:Hint}You can assign skills to staff members of the ''Employee'' type only.
)))
You assign skills to services similarly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. You first select the appropriate service (that is, the appropriate non-stock item of the ''Service'' type). Then on the '''Service Skills''' tab, you add a row for each skill needed for the service. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Needed_Skill|To Assign Skills to a Service].

A license is a document proving that a particular person has permission to perform work of a certain kind or has knowledge in a particular area. You first create license types, which are categories of licenses that are used for grouping licenses and associating a group of licenses with a service; you then enter all licenses (and assign license types to them when you enter them) that staff members or branches of your company own. You can then easily select the right staff member to perform a service for which special knowledge or permission is needed.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how license types and licenses are created in the system and then assigned to a staff member.{br}{TOC}
==Creating License Types==
Before you create the license types, you should gather the information about which license types are required for the services your company is going to perform, and identify their owner type. The ''license owner'' is the person or branch location to which the license was issued. {br}

There are two types of license owners:[anchor|#_84c0f2de-87b0-4685-b45f-7059b9c3e846]
*''Business'': You specify the ''Business'' owner type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_09_00|License Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200900|FS200900]) form if the licenses of this type are issued to an entire branch location rather than to a specific person. For instance, you can record a partnership as a license type for a particular branch, so this branch can have the partnership, and other branches cannot.
*''Staff Member'': You specify the ''Staff Member'' owner type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_09_00|License Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200900|FS200900]) form for a license type that is assigned to a staff member license (one issued to a staff member).
{br}

While gathering information about the required licenses, identify whether each is valid in only a particular area or in all locations. You can specify the location where the license is valid in two ways: by specifying the service area, or by specifying the country, state, and city. For details on service areas, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_geographical_zones|Service Areas].{br}

For details on how to add licenses to the system, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_a_license_type|To Add a License Type].{br}

You specify a license type for each license of a staff member or business that you enter into the system and assign the needed license types to services. When you select a staff member to perform a particular service of a service order or appointment by using the '''Staff Selector''' dialog box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, the system automatically suggests to you staff members that have licenses of the type that is necessary to provide the service. When you perform scheduling appointments by using calendar boards, you can filter the staff members by the types of the licenses that are needed for services. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Creation#_26c1bf84-f774-4be3-80d9-89c5aeeca13d|Assigning Staff Members] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Scheduling|Appointment Scheduling Options].
==Creating Licenses of Staff Members==
For licenses issued to individuals, one license is owned by only one staff member, and each staff member can have multiple licenses. You can create licenses of staff members by using the following forms:[anchor|#_f3940757-a9f5-4a3c-a871-e804283fb60a]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_10_00|Licenses] ([~/?ScreenId=FS201000|FS201000]) 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) 
((({S:Hint}You can enter licenses of the ''Business'' owner type only on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_10_00|Licenses] form (that is, not on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_assign_licences|To Create Licenses].
)))
When you save a newly created license, the system assigns it a reference number in accordance with the numbering sequence assigned to licenses in the '''License Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form.{br}

You can see the list of all the created licenses sorted by owner type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_40_20_PL| Licenses] (FS4020PL) form.
==Assigning License Types to Services==
To be able to select staff members for performing services based on the types of the licenses they have, you have to specify which license types are needed for each service. You can assign license types on the '''Service License Types''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_Needed_Licences|To Assign License Types to a Service].

In this topic, you will read about how to add service areas, and how to assign the appropriate service area to a staff member.
==Adding a Service Area==
You add a new service area by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_19_00|Service Areas] ([~/?ScreenId=FS201900|FS201900]) form. On this form, you enter the service area identifier and its description; then on the '''Postal Codes''' tab, you specify the ZIP codes that belong to the service area. To simplify the entry of many zip codes, we recommend that you prepare an Excel file ({{.xls}}) with the list of ZIP codes, and then upload records from the file. For details on how to add service areas to the system, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_geographical_zone|To Add a Service Area].{br}

After you save the information you have entered, you can assign the service areas to the appropriate staff members.

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_20_01|Staff Schedule Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202001|FS202001]) form, you select the staff member for whom you want to create a schedule rule, and you specify the following information: the branch, the branch location, the working period and time range of the staff member, and the schedule settings, which are described in the next section of this topic. For details on how to create a staff schedule rule, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_create_a_schedule_rule|To Create a Staff Schedule Rule].((({S:Hint}You can create rules for staff members of the ''Employee'' type only. For details on staff member types, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Staff_Members#_e97e4ef1-9014-4421-9a3b-e94b2c2e9504|Understanding Staff Member Types].
)))
You can create a schedule while you are enabling an employee as a staff member. To do this, you click the '''Schedule''' button on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form, which opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_40_10_PL|Staff Schedule Rules] form; you then perform the actions described above. After you create the schedule rule, you have to generate it in order to activate it in the system.[anchor|#_52d6d59c-7f64-4c98-bad3-b30206db5aad]
==Defining Schedule Settings==
For each schedule rule, you have to specify the type of schedule, recurrence frequency type, and schedule settings. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_20_01|Staff Schedule Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202001|FS202001]) form, you can create a schedule of either of the following types:[anchor|#_32206740-1022-4832-a531-bce0443d3ba9]
*'''Availability''': The schedule defines the times when a staff member is available to perform services.
*'''Unavailability''': The schedule defines the times when a staff member is not available to perform services (for instance, the times he or she is on vacation or sick leave).
{br}

Frequency type recurrence settings, which you also define on this form, define how often the schedule applies. There are four options:[anchor|#_b247f1ad-068b-4255-9aa8-0fb98ce6b4fc]
*'''Daily''': The schedule applies daily or every ''x'' days.
*'''Weekly''': The schedule applies weekly or every ''x'' weeks.
*'''Monthly''': The schedule applies monthly or every ''x'' months.
*'''Yearly''': The schedule applies yearly or every ''x'' years.
{br}

After you select the frequency type, you have to specify settings for the selected type as follows:[anchor|#ul_nxx_nrf_px]
*If you selected the '''Daily''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in days when the schedule applies. For example, if you specify every 1 day, the schedule applies every day, and if you specify every 2 days,the schedule applies every other day.
*If you selected the '''Weekly''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in weeks and the day or days of the week when the schedule applies. For example, if you specify every 2 weeks and select Monday, the schedule applies Monday of every other week.
*If you selected the '''Monthly''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in months and the day or days of the month when the schedule applies. There are two options for specifying the day: by the number of the day of the month, or by the week of the month and the day of the week. For example, you can specify that the schedule repeats every 2 months on the 2nd day of the month, or on the 2nd Monday of the month. You can specify up to four days for the '''Monthly''' frequency type.
*If you selected the '''Yearly''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in years, the month or months of the year, and the day of the month when the schedule applies. There are two options for specifying the day of the month: by the number of the day of the month (for example, every 2 years on the 2nd day of February and March), or by the week of the month and the day of the week (for example, every year on the 2nd Monday of February and March).
{br}

For instance, suppose a staff member of your company is available to work on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday every week for 6 hours (between 10:00 and 16:00). You define the schedule settings of the staff schedule rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_20_01|Staff Schedule Rules] form as follows:[anchor|#_9378a14e-27b3-4324-bb1c-68f3e40e1b84]
#You set the type of the schedule to '''Availability''' by clicking that option button.
#You specify the start and end time in the '''Scheduling Time''' section as 10:00 and 16:00.
#You set the frequency type of schedule recurrence to '''Weekly''' (that is, you select this option button under '''Frequency Settings''' on the '''Recurrence''' tab).
#In the '''Weekly''' section, you set the time interval when the schedule applies to '''Every 1 Weeks'''.
#You select the '''Monday''', '''Wednesday''', and '''Friday''' check boxes.
{br}

On the '''Recurrence''' tab of the form (right of '''Frequency Settings'''), you see the description of your schedule recurrence: ''Occurs Every 1 Weeks on Monday, Wednesday, Friday''.
==Generating a Schedule==
You have to generate the created schedule rules for a certain period of time for staff members. This activates them in the system, so you can select a staff member for performing service by the schedule (that is, by the time when he or she is available to perform services). You can generate schedules manually or create an automation schedule to generate these scheduling rules. For more information on automation, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing].{br}

To generate schedules manually, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_04_00|Generate Staff Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500400|FS500400]) form. You can navigate directly to this form, or you can navigate to this form from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_20_01|Staff Schedule Rules] form by clicking the '''Generate Staff Schedules''' button on the form toolbar. (This button becomes available after the staff schedule rule has been saved.) On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_04_00|Generate Staff Schedules] form, you can filter the list by staff member, branch, and branch location, and you have to select the date up to which you want to generate schedules in the system. You can then generate all listed staff schedule rules or only those you select. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_generate_a_staff_schedule|To Generate Staff Schedules].{br}

Once you have generated staff schedules, you can assign staff members to appointments or service orders according to their schedules by using the calendar boards. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Scheduling|Appointment Scheduling Options].
==Viewing the Staff Schedule Rules and the Generated Schedules==
You can use the following forms to view schedule rules:[anchor|#_7acfc5b6-c641-46bc-8c98-001ee3b04e64]
*If you want to see all schedules created in the system or all schedules for a particular staff member, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_40_10_PL|Staff Schedule Rules] (FS4010PL) form. You can view the schedule rules for a particular staff member by selecting the staff member in the '''Employee Name''' box. For each schedule rule, you can view (and change if needed) its details by clicking the schedule number in the '''Staff Schedule Nbr.''' column.
*If you want to see the list of schedule rules that have not yet been generated, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_04_00|Generate Staff Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500400|FS500400]) form. For each schedule rule, you can view (and change if needed) its details by clicking the schedule number in the '''Staff Schedule Nbr.''' column.
*If you want to view and change the generated schedules for a particular staff member for the current business week, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_05_00|Staff Working Schedule Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300500|FS300500]) form. You can also change the calendar settings to view the staff member schedule for the selected date, the week of the selected date, or the month of the selected date. Also, you can filter staff member schedule rules by branch and branch location.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Staff Schedules You can record and manage the work schedules of the staff members of your company who perform     services. For this purpose, you create staff schedule rules for each staff member that indicate     the work times when the staff member is available or not available for performing the service.     You then generate a schedule for a certain period of time according to the created rules. In this topic, you will read about the creation of staff schedule rules, the schedule rule     settings, and the generation, tracking, and modification of staff schedules. Creating a Staff Schedule Rule For each staff member, you can create a personal schedule rule that indicates his or her work     times. You create a new staff schedule rule by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202001|FS202001]) Staff Schedule Rules     (FS202001) form, which opens when you click the  Add Row  button on the     form toolbar of the  Staff Schedule Rules (FS4010PL) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202001|FS202001]) Staff Schedule Rules (FS202001) form, you select the staff member for whom you want to     create a schedule rule, and you specify the following information: the branch, the branch     location, the working period and time range of the staff member, and the schedule settings,     which are described in the next section of this topic. For details on how to create a staff     schedule rule, see  To Create a Staff Schedule Rule. You can create rules for staff members of the  Employee  type only. For details on     staff member types, see  Understanding Staff Member Types. You can create a schedule while you are enabling an employee as a staff member. To do this,     you click the  Schedule  button on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form, which opens the  Staff Schedule Rules     form; you then perform the actions described above. After you create the schedule rule, you have     to generate it in order to activate it in the system. Defining Schedule Settings For each schedule rule, you have to specify the type of schedule, recurrence frequency type,     and schedule settings. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202001|FS202001]) Staff Schedule Rules (FS202001) form, you can create     a schedule of either of the following types: Availability : The schedule defines the times when a staff member is       available to perform services. Unavailability : The schedule defines the times when a staff member       is not available to perform services (for instance, the times he or she is on vacation or sick       leave). Frequency type recurrence settings, which you also define on this form, define how often the     schedule applies. There are four options: Daily : The schedule applies daily or every  x  days. Weekly : The schedule applies weekly or every  x  weeks. Monthly : The schedule applies monthly or every  x  months. Yearly : The schedule applies yearly or every  x  years. After you select the frequency type, you have to specify settings for the selected type as      follows: If you selected the  Daily  frequency type, you have to specify the       time interval in days when the schedule applies. For example, if you specify every 1 day, the       schedule applies every day, and if you specify every 2 days,the schedule applies every other       day. If you selected the  Weekly  frequency type, you have to specify the       time interval in weeks and the day or days of the week when the schedule applies. For example,       if you specify every 2 weeks and select Monday, the schedule applies Monday of every other       week. If you selected the  Monthly  frequency type, you have to specify the       time interval in months and the day or days of the month when the schedule applies. There are       two options for specifying the day: by the number of the day of the month, or by the week of       the month and the day of the week. For example, you can specify that the schedule repeats       every 2 months on the 2nd day of the month, or on the 2nd Monday of the month. You can specify       up to four days for the  Monthly  frequency type. If you selected the  Yearly  frequency type, you have to specify the       time interval in years, the month or months of the year, and the day of the month when the       schedule applies. There are two options for specifying the day of the month: by the number of       the day of the month (for example, every 2 years on the 2nd day of February and March), or by       the week of the month and the day of the week (for example, every year on the 2nd Monday of       February and March). For instance, suppose a staff member of your company is available to work on Monday,     Wednesday, and Friday every week for 6 hours (between 10:00 and 16:00). You define the schedule     settings of the staff schedule rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202001|FS202001]) Staff Schedule Rules form as follows: You set the type of the schedule to  Availability  by clicking that       option button. You specify the start and end time in the  Scheduling Time  section as       10:00 and 16:00. You set the frequency type of schedule recurrence to  Weekly  (that       is, you select this option button under  Frequency Settings  on the         Recurrence  tab). In the  Weekly  section, you set the time interval when the schedule       applies to  Every 1 Weeks . You select the  Monday ,  Wednesday , and         Friday  check boxes. On the  Recurrence  tab of the form (right of  Frequency      Settings ), you see the description of your schedule recurrence:  Occurs Every 1      Weeks on Monday, Wednesday, Friday . Generating a Schedule You have to generate the created schedule rules for a certain period of time for staff     members. This activates them in the system, so you can select a staff member for performing     service by the schedule (that is, by the time when he or she is available to perform services).     You can generate schedules manually or create an automation schedule to generate these     scheduling rules. For more information on automation, see  Scheduled Processing. To generate schedules manually, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500400|FS500400]) Generate Staff Schedules (FS500400)     form.

Once you have generated staff schedules, you can assign staff members to appointments or     service orders according to their schedules by using the calendar boards. For details, see  Appointment Scheduling Options. Viewing the Staff Schedule Rules and the Generated Schedules You can use the following forms to view schedule rules: If you want to see all schedules created in the system or all schedules for a particular       staff member, you use the  Staff Schedule Rules (FS4010PL) form.

Before you start to record the services provided by your company, the customers&rsquo; data should be entered into the system and configured for use with the field service functionality.{br}

This topic describes the customer account setup needed for use with the field service functionality.
==Adding Customer Accounts==
You should create any customer accounts that will be used in Service Management and are not already defined in the system. In Acumatica ERP, customer accounts are created and managed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. For details on how to manage customer accounts in the system, see the [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_Customers|Managing Customers] chapter of the Accounts Receivable User Guide.((({S:Hint} If you are going to add many customer accounts to the system, we recommend that you create an import scenario and upload the data from a file. For details on importing scenarios, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Simplified_Import_Scenarios|Simplified Scenarios for Data Import].
))){br}

To use existing customer accounts in field services management, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_cc827542-fef9-40a6-b422-f9fe36ab2204]
#You configure all the billing cycles you will use for customers; you then assign a billing cycle (or multiple billing cycles) to each customer account to be able to generate invoices for services that are provided. For details on billing cycles, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Billing_Cycle|Billing Cycle Settings].
#If you want to send emails to customers with details on appointments, you set up email notifications. For details on setting up notifications, see the [[#_a964d53a-3ba9-4ece-8bd1-adfe7910e0df|Configuring Notifications] section of this topic.
[anchor|#_a964d53a-3ba9-4ece-8bd1-adfe7910e0df]
==Configuring Notifications==
If your company may need to notify customers about their service appointments, you can allow a service manager (a person who enters service orders and appointments into the system) or scheduler (a person who plans appointments with customers) to notify the customer related to the service appointment. You make this possible by selecting the '''Allow Appointment Notifications''' check box in the '''Service Management''' section of the '''Billing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form for the customer. On this form (in the '''Bill-To Contact''' section of the '''Billing Settings''' tab), you also check whether email address is specified for the customer, and if not, you specify the email address to which the customer wants to receive notifications.

Billing cycles define the method used to generate the billing documents for the services provided to customers. For each customer account created in the system for use with the field services functionality, you have to assign at least one billing cycle.{br}

In this topic, you will read about setting up the billing cycle settings and configuring and changing customer billing.{br}{TOC}
==Setting Up the Invoicing Setting==
The invoicing setting of each billing cycle defines the level of detail presented in a service-related billing document to be issued to a customer. To specify the invoicing setting, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, under '''Generate Invoices From''', you select one of the following option buttons:[anchor|#_5de899b0-a045-4638-bb27-8cd240c37413]
*'''Appointments''': With this button selected, a generated billing document includes the details on each appointment. This setting can be specified if you want to generate billing documents for completed or closed appointments.
*'''Service Orders''': With this button selected, the generated billing document includes the details on only the service order.  This option can be used when you want to bill for the estimated work time, no matter how many hours the appointment actually took, or you want to generate billing documents for appointments that will happen in the future.
((({S:Hint}You can set up the system to generate billing documents for only ''Completed'' or ''Closed'' service orders by selecting the '''Generate Invoices for Only Completed or Closed Service Orders''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] form.
)))
==Setting Up Grouping Settings==
The billing cycle defines how the appointments or service orders are grouped in the billing documents that are issued to customers. To specify the grouping setting, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] form, under '''Group Invoices By''', you select one of the following option buttons:[anchor|#_7a675ec9-3116-4d8b-883c-42a1d4132a95]
*'''Appointments''': For every appointment billed, one billing document is generated. That is, with this setting, appointments are not grouped during the billing process. 
*'''Service Orders''': For all the appointments corresponding to the same service order, one billing document is generated.
*'''Customer Order''': For all the appointments corresponding to the same customer order, one billing document is generated.
*:((({S:Hint}The customer order associated with each service is defined in the '''Customer Order''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form. If you select this option button, the work order associated with each service must be specified.
)))
*'''External Reference''': For all the appointments corresponding to the same external document, one billing document is generated. 
*:((({S:Hint}The external document associated with each service is defined in the '''External Reference''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form. If you select this option button, the work order associated with each service must be specified.
)))
*'''Time Frame''': For all the appointments for one customer in a given period of time, one billing document is generated. You can set a specific day of the week or a particular day of the month. For instance, if the fixed day of the month is 6, a billing document is generated for all not-yet-invoiced appointments on the 6th day of every month, and if the fixed day of the week is Monday, a billing document is generated on Monday every week.

== Configuring a Customer Billing==
Based on your requirements for billing customers, you decide on the invoicing and grouping settings of the billing cycles. For each customer, you can use either one billing cycle or multiple billing cycles. You specify one billing cycle for a customer if you want to generate billing documents in the same way and with the same details for all types of service orders. You specify multiple billing cycles for a customer if you want to apply different invoicing or grouping settings to different types of service orders. For examples of billing cycles, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Billing_Cycles_Examples|Examples of Billing Cycles].{br}

You take the following general steps to configure customer billing:[anchor|#_030a3527-2ffe-403e-b091-931359fe8a5a]
# If you want the capability to assign different billing cycles to different service order types for a particular customer, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form, you select the '''Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer''' check box. If you don&rsquo;t need this capability, the check box should be cleared.
#:((({S:Hint}If you configure multiple billing cycles, for each customer, you have to assign a billing cycle to every type of service order you are going to provide.
)))
# You create the billing cycles on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form. For details on how to create a billing cycle, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle].
# You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form to assign a particular billing cycle or multiple billing cycles to each customer you are going to provide services to. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].

==Changing a Customer Billing==
If you used one billing cycle for customers and after some time you realized that you need to use different billing cycles for different service order types for the customers, you can configure customer billing with multiple billing options. To do so, you select the '''Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form.{br}

After you have selected the check box, for each customer that has service orders entered to the system, the system identifies types of entered service orders and adds a line for each service order type on the '''Service Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. The billing settings for each service order type are the billing setting that were set for a customer when it had single billing cycle in the '''Service Management ''' section of the '''Billing Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

For each service order type, you can change the billing cycle. You can also add other service order types for the customer.{br}

Consider the following example. The system was set as follows:[anchor|#_0f400b7a-e714-4c3f-997f-a4bc67d1913c]
*The '''Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] form.
*The following service order types are entered to the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form:'' INST, INT, MRO, QUOT, ROUT''.
*The following billing settings are configured for a customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form:
**'''Billing Cycle''': Invoice by Appointments/Group by Appointments
**'''Bill-To Address''': ''Default Billing Customer Location''
** '''Ship-To Address''': ''Service Order''
*The customer has two service orders entered in the system with the following service order types: ''MRO'' and ''INST''.

Then you decided to generate billing documents for the service orders of the ''INST'' type by each service order. To do so, you select the '''Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form, the '''Service Billing''' tab appears and displays two records, one for each service order type (''MRO'' and'' INST''). Each one should include the customer&rsquo;s previous billing settings (billing cycle, bill-to address, and ship-to address). You then can change the billing cycle for the service orders of the ''INST'' type.

To specify the invoicing         setting, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) Billing Cycles (FS206000) form, under  Generate           Invoices From , you select one of the following option buttons: Appointments : With this button selected, a generated billing           document includes the details on each appointment. This setting can be specified if you           want to generate billing documents for completed or closed appointments. Service Orders : With this button selected, the generated billing           document includes the details on only the service order.                       This option can be used when you want to bill for the estimated work time, no matter how           many hours the appointment actually took, or you want to generate billing documents for           appointments that will happen in the future. You can set up the system to generate billing documents for only  Completed  or            Closed  service orders by selecting the  Generate Invoices for Only           Completed or Closed Service Orders  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) Billing Cycles form. Setting Up Grouping Settings The billing cycle defines how the appointments or service orders are grouped in the billing         documents that are issued to customers. To specify the grouping setting, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) Billing Cycles form, under  Group Invoices By , you select         one of the following option buttons: Appointments : For every appointment billed, one billing document is           generated. That is, with this setting, appointments are not grouped during the billing           process.  Service Orders : For all the appointments corresponding to the same           service order, one billing document is generated. Customer Order : For all the appointments corresponding to the same           customer order, one billing document is generated. The customer order associated with             each service is defined in the  Customer Order  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form. If you select this option button, the work             order associated with each service must be specified. External Reference : For all the appointments corresponding to the           same external document, one billing document is generated.  The external document             associated with each service is defined in the  External Reference              box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders form. If you select this option button, the             work order associated with each service must be specified. Time Frame : For all the appointments for one customer in a given           period of time, one billing document is generated. You can set a specific day of the week           or a particular day of the month. For instance, if the fixed day of the month is 6, a           billing document is generated for all not-yet-invoiced appointments on the 6th day of           every month, and if the fixed day of the week is Monday, a billing document is generated           on Monday every week.  Configuring a Customer Billing Based on your requirements for billing customers, you decide on the invoicing and grouping         settings of the billing cycles. For each customer, you can use either one billing cycle or         multiple billing cycles. You specify one billing cycle for a customer if you want to         generate billing documents in the same way and with the same details for all types of         service orders. You specify multiple billing cycles for a customer if you want to apply         different invoicing or grouping settings to different types of service orders. For examples         of billing cycles, see  Examples of Billing Cycles. You take the following general steps to configure customer billing:  If you want the capability to assign different billing cycles to different service           order types for a particular customer, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form, you select the  Manage Multiple Billing Options per             Customer  check box. If you don't need this capability, the check box should           be cleared. If you configure multiple billing cycles, for each customer, you have to             assign a billing cycle to every type of service order you are going to           provide.  You create the billing cycles on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) Billing Cycles           (FS206000) form. For details on how to create a billing cycle, see  To Add a Billing Cycle.  You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form to assign a particular           billing cycle or multiple billing cycles to each customer you are going to provide           services to. For details, see  To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer. Changing a Customer Billing If you used one billing cycle for customers and after some time you realized that you need to use different billing cycles for different service order types for the customers, you can configure customer billing with multiple billing options. To do so, you select the  Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form. After you have selected the check box, for each customer that has service orders entered to the system, the system identifies  types of entered service orders and adds a line for each service order type on the  Service Billing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. The billing settings for each service order type are the billing setting that were set for a customer when it had single billing cycle in the  Service Management   section of the  Billing Settings  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. For each service order type, you can change the billing cycle. You can also add other service order types for the customer. Consider the following example. The system was set as follows: The  Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer  check box is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences form. The following service order types are entered to the system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form:  INST, INT, MRO, QUOT, ROUT . The following billing settings are configured for a customer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form: Billing Cycle : Invoice by Appointments/Group by Appointments Bill-To Address :  Default Billing Customer Location Ship-To Address :  Service Order The customer has two service orders entered in the system with the following service order types:  MRO  and  INST . Then you decided to generate billing documents for the service orders of the  INST  type by         each service order. To do so, you select the  Manage Multiple Billing Options per           Customer  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences form.         On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form, the  Service Billing  tab         appears and displays two records, one for each service order type ( MRO  and            INST ). Each one should include the customer's previous billing settings (billing         cycle, bill-to address, and ship-to address).

In this topic, you will read about examples of billing cycles that can be created in the system. For details on billing cycles, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Billing_Cycle|Billing Cycle Settings].{br}

The figures shown in the examples illustrate the details of the service orders to be used in each example, the appointments created for them, and the documents generated for the appointments for the different grouping settings of the billing cycles. The appointments are highlighted according to the grouping settings of the billing cycle. {br}{TOC}
==Generating Invoices from Appointments==
Suppose that you have configured a billing cycle with the following settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form and assigned it to a customer:[anchor|#_31f333a6-8ed5-46c7-b019-3f17884876d5]
*'''Group Invoices By''' setting: '''Appointment'''
* '''Generate Invoices From''' setting: '''Appointments'''

After you have created service orders and their appointments for this customer and processed them in the system, you generate a billing document (AR invoice, AP bill, sales order, or SO invoice, depending on the service order type settings). Based on the billing cycle settings, a separate document is generated for each appointment (see the highlighted areas in Figure 1). The billing document presents the details of each service of the appointment.{br}

In Figure 1, you see the details of the service orders and appointments and the details of the billing documents generated according to the settings of the billing cycle.[anchor|#_68d09bd1-37f5-4b5d-9524-b9c3cbd70af7][anchor|#_5494004a-2d37-4540-a1ee-0dc4aae5f083][image:UserGuide/Images/FS_AP_AP.png|popup|Figure 1: Generate invoices for appointments and group by appointment|450px]
Suppose that you have configured a billing cycle with the following settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] form and assigned it to a customer:[anchor|#_8df1bb0d-06c9-4641-b6af-7f1acee70d8f]

==Generating Invoices for Multiple Billing Cycles==
Suppose that you provide different types of services to a customer. You provide the services of the first type regularly, so you decided to generate one document for all appointments that took place in a certain period of time to bill the customer. You provide the services of the second type rarely to the customer, so you decided to generate one document for each appointment right after the appointment is completed. You have configured billing cycles with the following settings and assigned them to the customer: [anchor|#_dc90077f-f89b-4c2e-a973-93ca512cef68]
*Billing cycle settings for the service order of Type 1:
**'''Group Invoices By''' setting: '''Time Cycle''' (on the 15th of every month)
**'''Generate Invoices From''' setting: '''Appointments'''
*Billing cycle settings for the service order of Type 2:
**'''Group Invoices By''' setting: '''Appointment'''
** '''Generate Invoices From''' setting: '''Appointments'''
{br}

After you have created service orders and their appointments for this customer and processed them in the system, you generate a billing document (AR invoice, AP bill, sales order, or SO invoice, depending on the service order type settings). Based on the billing cycle settings, a separate document is generated for each appointment for service orders of Type 1. For each service orders of Type 2, a separate document is generated. (See the highlighted areas in Figure 8). The billing documents for service orders of Type 1 present details on each service for each appointment. In the billing documents for service orders of Type 2, details on each service for each service order are presented, and appointments are not necessarily created and processed in the system.{br}

Figure 8, shown below, illustrates the details of the service orders of different service types created for one customer, the details of appointments, and the details of the billing documents generated according to the settings of the billing cycles.[anchor|#_60bdc198-620a-4029-87ac-38a76faa9945][anchor|#_e23d6f62-b330-4fcd-8a73-99584ae76282][image:UserGuide/Images/FS_Multiple_Billing_Cycles.png|popup|Figure 8: Multiple billing cycles|450px]

For each customer account created in the system for use with the field services functionality, you have to assign at least one billing cycle that defines the method used to generate the invoices for the services provided to customers.{br}

In this topic, you will read about configuring the billing process to be used with customer accounts.{br}{TOC}
== Configuration of Customer Billing==
Based on your requirements for billing customers, you decide on the invoicing and grouping settings of the billing cycles. For each customer, you can use either one billing cycle or multiple billing cycles. You specify one billing cycle for a customer if you want to generate invoices in the same way and with the same details for all types of service orders. You specify multiple billing cycles for a customer if you want to apply different invoicing or grouping settings to different types of service orders. For examples of billing cycles, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Billing_Cycles_Examples|Examples of Billing Cycles].{br}

You take the following general steps to configure customer billing:[anchor|#_030a3527-2ffe-403e-b091-931359fe8a5a]
# If you want the capability to assign different billing cycles to different service order types for particular customers, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form, you select the '''Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer''' check box. If you don&rsquo;t need this capability for any customers, the check box should be cleared.
#:((({S:Hint}If you configure multiple billing cycles, for each customer, you have to assign a billing cycle to every type of service order you are going to provide.
)))
# You create the billing cycles on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form. For details on how to create a billing cycle, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle].
# You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form to assign a particular billing cycle or multiple billing cycles to each customer you are going to provide services to. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].

==Changes to Customer Billing==
If you have used one billing cycle for each of your customers and later realized that you need to use different billing cycles for different service order types for the customers, you can configure customer billing to permit multiple billing options. To do so, you select the '''Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form.{br}

After you have selected the check box, for each customer that has service orders entered into the system, the system identifies the types of these service orders. The system then adds a line for each service order type related to service orders of a particular customer on the '''Service Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. For each service order type, the customer's billing settings (billing cycle, bill-to address, and ship-to address) are the billing settings that were set for this customer when it had single billing cycle in the '''Service Management ''' section of the '''Billing Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

For each service order type, you can change the billing cycle. You can also add other service order types for the customer.
==Example of Changing a Customer Billing==
Consider the following example. The system has been configured as follows:[anchor|#_66fdeb16-eb68-4729-b411-343e047045e9]
*The '''Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer''' check box has been cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form.
*The following service order types have been entered into the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form:'' INST, INT, MRO, QUOT, ''and ''ROUT''.
*The following billing settings have been specified for a customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form:
**'''Billing Cycle''': Generate Invoices From Appointments and Group Invoices by Appointments
**'''Bill-To Address''': ''Default Billing Customer Location''
** '''Ship-To Address''': ''Service Order''
*Two service orders have been entered into the system for the customer with the following service order types: ''MRO'' and ''INST''.

Then you decide to generate invoices for the service orders of the ''INST'' type by each service order. To do so, you select the '''Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] form. You then open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form and select the customer. On the form, the '''Service Billing''' tab, which appeared when you selected the check box, displays two rows, one for each service order type (''MRO'' and'' INST''). Each row includes the customer&rsquo;s previous billing settings (billing cycle, bill-to address, and ship-to address). You then change the billing cycle for the service orders of the ''INST'' type.

For details, see  To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer. Changes to Customer Billing If you have used one billing cycle for each of your customers and later realized that you         need to use different billing cycles for different service order types for the customers,         you can configure customer billing to permit multiple billing options. To do so, you select         the  Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer  check box on the             ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form. After you have selected the check box, for each customer that has service orders entered         into the system, the system identifies the types of these service orders. The system then         adds a line for each service order type related to service orders of a particular customer         on the  Service Billing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers         (AR303000) form. For each service order type, the customer's billing settings (billing         cycle, bill-to address, and ship-to address) are the billing settings that were set for this         customer when it had single billing cycle in the  Service Management           section of the  Billing Settings  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. For each service order type, you can change the billing cycle. You can also add other         service order types for the customer. Example of Changing a Customer Billing Consider the following example. The system has been configured as follows: The  Manage Multiple Billing Options per Customer  check box has           been cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form. The following service order types have been entered into the system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form:  INST, INT, MRO, QUOT,  and              ROUT . The following billing settings have been specified for a customer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form: Billing Cycle : Generate Invoices From Appointments and Group               Invoices by Appointments Bill-To Address :  Default Billing Customer               Location Ship-To Address :  Service Order Two service orders have been entered into the system for the customer with the following           service order types:  MRO  and  INST . Then you decide to generate invoices for the service orders of the  INST  type by each         service order. To do so, you select the  Manage Multiple Billing Options per           Customer  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences form.         You then open the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form and select the customer. On the form,         the  Service Billing  tab, which appeared when you selected the check         box, displays two rows, one for each service order type ( MRO  and  INST ). Each         row includes the customer's previous billing settings (billing cycle, bill-to address, and         ship-to address). You then change the billing cycle for the service orders of the            INST  type.   ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000])  ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) ]]></column>

If the billing cycle you use for this service order type is set to                             group invoices by appointment or service order, in the                                  Frequency Type  column, select one of the                             following options to define the time frequency when the documents are                             eligible to be posted:  Weekly : The documents are eligible to be posted at the                                     end of the week.  Monthly : The documents are eligible to be posted at the                                     end of the month.

In Acumatica ERP, a ''service class'' is a group of services that have similar characteristics. You can divide services into classes based on the types of services the customers buy or on other properties, such as billing rules or units of measure. When you create a service that your company offers in the system, you first specify the applicable service class, which causes the system to fill in the values of the class for the service. Any of these default values can be overridden.{br}

In this topic, you will read about creating service classes and selecting billing rules for them.
==Creating Service Classes==
You create a service class as a non-stock item class with the ''Service'' item type by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. (In the system, services are defined as non-stock items with the Service type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.) In addition to the general mandatory settings for non-stock item classes, you have to select a billing rule for the service class, as described in the following section. Depending on the service class, you can specify optional settings that you want to be applied to the services of the class, such as tax category, posting class, or price class. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Configuration_of_Basic_Inventory|Configuration of Basic Inventory].{br}

You can view the list of created service classes with their default billing rules on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_40_09_00|Service Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS400900|FS400900]) form.[anchor|#_43a959eb-33d6-4aae-936c-3fef0b8eb79d]
==Selecting Billing Rules==
A ''billing rule'' is a system setting that defines the method used to calculate the total prices for services provided to customers. You can select one of the following options:[anchor|#_019c1808-9195-42b4-b944-0168e54b5b05]
*''Time'': The service price is calculated according to the time that staff members spent delivering the service. The unit price of the service is defined per unit of time, and to calculate the transaction amount, the system multiplies the unit price by the quantity of units of time. 
*''Flat Rate'': The service price is a fixed price for performing the service, regardless of the time that was spent to perform the service. 
*''None'': No service price is calculated, and the customer is not billed. (This option is used when the service is provided to a customer for free or to your own company). 
{br}

The selected billing rule of the class is set by default for all the services of the class when you create them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. You can override the default billing rule when you create the service or when you add the service to a service order or appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, respectively.

In Acumatica ERP, you can easily enter, store, and manage information about the services your company provides to customers. For each service, you can enter specific information, such as the following:[anchor|#_731e0b90-d86d-4aef-a71d-69948e27530d]
*The skills needed for performing the service
*The types of licenses that a staff member or the branch location needs to have for the service to be performed
*The equipment types that are necessary to perform the service
{br}

In your company, you may need this information to select the right staff member when you assign staff members to perform services. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Creation#_26c1bf84-f774-4be3-80d9-89c5aeeca13d|Assigning Staff Members].{br}

In this topic, you will read about creating services, adding prices, and specifying additional information for the services.{br}{TOC}
==Creating Services==
You add the services of your company to the system as non-stock items of the ''Service'' item type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. Before you create services, you create service classes—that is, item classes created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form with the ''Service'' item type—as described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Classes|Service Classes]. Then when you enter a non-stock item that represents a service on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form, you select the appropriate item class defined for services of the type, and the system automatically assigns to the item the ''Service'' type and the other settings you have specified for the item class. You also specify the estimated duration of service execution, the default billing rule (if it is different than the one specified for the class), and the posting class and tax category, if they were not specified for the selected service class or if you want to override the class settings. Optionally, you specify price information, skills, license types, and resource equipment types. For more details on non-stock items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Non-Stock_Item_Support|Non-Stock Items in the Inventory Module].{br}

You can view a list of the created services (and their details, including service class, estimated duration, and default billing rule) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_40_08_00|Services] ([~/?ScreenId=FS400800|FS400800]) form.
==Specifying Skills and License Types==
If services require special skills or knowledge, you should define them in the system so you can select the right person when you assign staff members to perform services. Before you start adding services to the system, we recommend that you make sure that the required skills and license types have been entered into the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_06_00|Skills] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200600|FS200600]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_09_00|License Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200900|FS200900]) forms. If the required skills and license types are defined in the system, you assign skills on the '''Service Skills''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form and license types on the '''Service License Types''' tab of this form. For details on skills and licenses, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_skills|Skills] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_licences|Licenses].
==Specifying Resource Equipment Types==
If special equipment must be used to perform the services you are entering, we recommend that you make sure that all necessary equipment types have been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_08_00|Equipment Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) form. You can then assign these types to the appropriate services on the '''Resource Equipment Types''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form. For details on equipment types, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Resource_Equipment|Resource Equipment].
==Specifying the Route Management Settings==
You can create route services on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form where you create the services. For these services, you can indicate the items that are being picked up or delivered in the appointment on the '''Pickup/Delivery Items''' tab of the form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Configuraton_Inventory|Configuration of the System for Inventory Updates] in the Route Management guide.

In Acumatica ERP, you can enter and keep information about ''resource equipment'' and equipment types. Resource equipment is a physical resource of your company that staff members use to perform services. Equipment types are categories that are used for grouping equipment and associating a group of equipment with a service. You create equipment types, specify the appropriate type for each resource equipment, and assign equipment types to services. This ensures that the right equipment will later be selected to perform these services.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how equipment types are created and assigned to equipment and services in the system, how resource equipment is added to the system, and how this equipment is assigned to appointments.{br}{TOC}
==Creating Equipment Types==
Equipment types structure the data in the system and make it easier to select the right equipment for performing services. Equipment of one equipment type is used to perform similar types of work. For instance, if your company provides installation services, you might create the first equipment type for all drills of the company and the second equipment type for screwdrivers. {br}

You create equipment types on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_08_00|Equipment Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_Equipment_Type|To Add an Equipment Type].
==Adding Resource Equipment==
You add each specific entity of resource equipment (using the previous example, a specific screwdriver or drill) that you are going to use to perform services on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form. You have to specify to the system that this item is resource equipment by selecting the '''Resource Equipment''' check box, assign the type of equipment, and specify that you are an owner by selecting the '''Company''' option button on the form (under '''Owner''' in the Summary area). For details on how to add a resource equipment, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_a_Resource_Equipment|To Add Resource Equipment].{br}

To maintain all details of each equipment entity you add to the system, you can record additional information, such as its general, manufacturing, and purchase information. {br}

Also, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_80_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=EP208000|EP208000]) form (Organization), which is generally used to define equipment that can be used for projects. For any equipment that has been added to your system by using this form, you can make it available for use with the service management functionality by clicking '''Extend to SM Equipment''' on the form toolbar and then specifying the necessary information.[anchor|#_d0dc7e95-2de4-4abe-99ac-d8c99998a0b9]
==Specifying Attributes==
To give users the ability to specify additional information for a piece of equipment, so that your company can track this information, attributes have to be defined for the related equipment type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_08_00|Equipment Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Equipment_Types#_5903681c-4c3c-417e-af0b-d127f27487b7|Setting Up Attributes for Equipment Type].{br}

When you create a piece of equipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form and select its equipment type, the system populates the '''Attributes''' tab with the attributes (and any default values) defined for the equipment type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_08_00|Equipment Types] form. You can specify or modify equipment attribute values in the '''Values''' column. If the '''Required''' check box is selected for an attribute, the value has to be specified before you save the new equipment you are creating.{br}

Also on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form are the '''Image''' set of elements, which you can use to attach an image of the piece of equipment.
==Assigning Equipment Types to Services==
You can specify which equipment types are needed for each service. Services are defined in the system as non-stock items of the ''Service'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. You assign the appropriate equipment types to the service on the '''Resource Equipment Types''' tab of this form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_Needed_Equipment|To Assign Equipment Types to a Service].
==Assigning Resource Equipment to Appointments==
You can assign the necessary equipment to the appointments of a particular service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form or to a particular appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form. You assign the resource equipment on the '''Resource Equipment''' tab of either form. On this tab, for each equipment entity you want to add, you add a row and select the necessary equipment entity from the list in the '''Equipment ID '''column. 
==Viewing Equipment Details==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_40_01_00|Appointment Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=FS400100|FS400100]) form, you can view the list of all equipment added to the system and its general information, such as type, description, serial number, owner information, model, and installation date. You can filter the list by equipment type, customer (for equipment that customers own), customer location, and model (stock item ID). {br}

To view the details of particular equipment, you can click an equipment number in the '''Equipment Nbr.''' column, which causes the system to bring up its details on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] form. Also, on the '''History''' tab, you can view the list of service orders to which the equipment is related, and the details of each service order.

With the field services functionality of Acumatica ERP, you can process and track services that customers of your company have ordered. You can use two types of documents in the system when processing orders: service order and appointment. A service order document represents general information on the services that will be provided and the appointments that will take place. An appointment document represents one in-person meeting to perform one service or multiple services included in a service order.{br}

 This chapter describes general service order processing steps available in Acumatica ERP.

In Acumatica ERP, you can control the steps required to process your company&rsquo;s service orders, from entering them to closing them and generating invoices.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the general workflow of processing service orders.{br}{TOC}
==Understanding the Workflow==
In general, the processing of a service order consists of the following steps:[anchor|#_2fbe3bc9-d9b8-4def-a6f6-e7932fe15550]
#Entering the service order: The scheduler or service manager receives the order and enters it into the system. For details on how to create a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Creation|Service Order Entry].
#(Optional) Entering a prepayment: The scheduler or service manager receives a prepayment and enters it to the system. For more information on processing of a service order with prepayments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Prepaid_Service_Orders|Prepaid Service Order].
#Processing the appointment or appointments: In this step, appointments are performed, appointment data is entered into the system, and all information related to the appointments is verified. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Appointment_Processing|Appointment Processing Workflow].
#Completing the service order: After all appointments related to the service order have been completed, the service order is completed in the system. For details, see the [[#_fb00868b-8fd7-4114-9557-ce0a4c7c7930|Completing a Service Order] section of this topic.
#Closing the service order: After all accounting information is verified, the accountant closes the service order. For details, see the [[#_0bbe7d2a-36c5-486a-9b78-d04f19f07ce4|Closing a Service Order] section of this topic.
#Processing invoices for the customer if the customer&rsquo;s billing cycle settings indicate that invoices should be generated by service order: The accountant approves service order for generation invoices. He or she then generates invoices for the service order (appointments do not necessarily have to be closed or completed) and processes them in the system. For details on how to bill the customer for provided services, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Invoices|Generation of Billing Documents from Service Orders].
{br}

Depending on your business processes, an appointment can be created in the system before the applicable service order, and service orders may not have any appointments. For examples of possible scenarios and their processing in the system, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Possible_Scenarios|Service Management Use Cases].{br}

During each step of service order processing, you can print information on this service order. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Print_Service_Order|To Print a Service Order or Quote].{br}

For detailed information about completing and closing a service order, see the following sections. [anchor|#_fb00868b-8fd7-4114-9557-ce0a4c7c7930]
==Completing a Service Order==
After all appointments related to the service order have been successfully completed (the '''Appointments Needed''' check box is cleared for the service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form), the appropriate employee (such as a service manager) makes sure all needed information has been entered into the service order and completes the service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Service_Order|To Complete Service Orders].{br}

If the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Completed''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, the service order is automatically completed when all related appointments have been completed. {br}

Once a service order is completed, it gets the ''Completed'' status in the system. If any additional service has to be performed or another appointment has to take place, the service order can be reopened and then completed after all work is done.[anchor|#_0bbe7d2a-36c5-486a-9b78-d04f19f07ce4]
==Closing a Service Order==
After the employee designated to approve service orders has checked the information in the completed service order and it is ready to be billed, the employee closes the service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form. For details on how to close a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].{br}

If the '''Close Service Orders When Its Appointments Are Closed''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]), the service order is automatically closed when all related appointments have been closed.{br}

Once the service order is closed, changes cannot be made to it, and it gets the ''Closed'' status. If any additional changes should be made in the service order, the service order can be unclosed.
==Canceling a Service Order==
If a service order is not going to be provided or the customer canceled it, you can cancel the service order (if it has the ''Open'' status) in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form. Once you cancel a service order, it is assigned the ''Canceled'' status. For details on how to cancel a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Cancel_Service_Order|To Cancel Service Orders]. If it is later determined that the canceled service order will take place, it can be reopened.
==Reopening a Service Order==
If you want to add any new appointments or services to the service order or provide services for a previously canceled service order, you can reopen a service order of the ''Completed'' or ''Canceled'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form. Once you reopen a service order, it gets the ''Open'' status, and you can add new services and create appointments. For details on how to reopen a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Reopen_Service_Order|To Reopen Service Orders].
==Unclosing a Service Order==
If you have already closed a service order, invoices were not generated for it, and now you need to change any information in it, you can unclose the service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form. Once you unclose a service order, it gets the ''Completed ''status, and information in the service order can be edited. For details on how to unclose a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Unclose_Service_Order|To Unclose Service Orders].

You enter orders that represent the services your company delivers to the customers. A service order is a document that provides the general information on the services that will be provided and the appointments that will take place. {br}

In this topic, you will read about how to enter a service order into the system and specify the necessary information.{br}{TOC}
==Entering a Service Order==
In general, you start your work with the service order by the entering the service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form. First, you select the type of service order. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Order_Types|Service Order Types].{br}

After you select the service order type, you specify the following information:[anchor|#_4d81dc4c-8a61-4eae-b832-c3a679894168]
*The customer and its location (and optionally, the attendees of the appointment from the customer&rsquo;s company)
*Your company&rsquo;s branch and its location (and if the appointments occur there, the room or rooms where the appointments take place)
*The date and time information of the service order
*The services that are included in this service order
*Optional: The staff members that perform the services of the order
*Optional: The appointments that are going to take place to deliver these services if any (for details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Appointments|Appointment Creation])
*Optional: Any included inventory items and resource equipment
*Optional: The values of the attributes for the service order
{br}

By default, the system assigns a new service order the ''Open'' status. Reference numbers for new orders are generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to the service order type in the '''Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form.{br}

If the service order is not ready to be performed yet, you can place it on hold by selecting the '''Hold''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form. With this check box selected, the status of the service order is ''On Hold''. A service order with this status can be edited, saved, or taken off hold.{br}

If needed, you can use quotes as templates for repeating service orders for a particular customer. In this case, you create service orders by copying the quotes. For details on creating and copying quotes, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Quotes|Quote Processing].
==Specifying Date and Time Information==
The Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form includes the '''Date''' box, where you should specify the date when the services has been ordered by the customer. By default, for each service order, the date of service order creation is filled in with the current business date.{br}

In the '''Service Order Settings''' tab on the '''Settings''' tab, you also can specify the approximate date when the service order will be completed in the '''Promised Date''' box, and the deadline date and time before which the service order has to be completed in the '''SLA''' box.
==Specifying Services==
You specify services that your company provides for the service order on the '''Services''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form. To do this, you click the '''Service Selector''' button on the table toolbar, and select the services included in this order from the list in the '''Service Selector''' dialog box. The list, which can be filtered by service class, contains all services that you have entered into the system. For details on services and service classes, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Services|Services] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Classes|Service Classes].{br}

Alternatively, you can add each service by clicking '''Add Row''' and manually selecting the service in the '''Service ID''' column of the row.[anchor|#_26c1bf84-f774-4be3-80d9-89c5aeeca13d]
==Assigning Staff Members==
For each service your company provides to the customer, you assign a staff member with the appropriate skills and licenses to deliver the service. In general, you assign staff members while you are planning the time of an appointment by using calendar boards. In this case, you can filter staff members by the skills and licenses needed for each service, and you plan the time when appointments will take place according to the work schedules and availability of staff members. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Scheduling|Appointment Scheduling Options].{br}

Alternatively, you can assign staff members on the '''Services''' or '''Staff''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form by clicking the '''Staff Selector''' button and selecting the staff member from the list in the '''Staff Selector''' dialog box. In the '''Staff Selector''' dialog box, the needed skills and license types specified for the service are already selected for it, and the system filters the list of staff members, showing only staff members who match the selection criteria. In this case, you do not take into consideration the work schedule of the staff member when selecting the appropriate staff member; this method of assigning staff members is convenient when it is not necessary to make an appointment for the service order.{br}

If the '''Enable Attendees''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] form for the selected service order type, you can assign multiple staff members to perform one service. Otherwise, you can assign only one staff member to each service.
==Specifying Inventory Items==
If your company provides services that may include selling items to the customer, you can specify these items on the '''Inventory Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form. (All the necessary inventory items must be created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form before you add them to a service order.) For details on stock items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Items|Inventory Items].
==Specifying Resource Equipment==
If the staff member needs special equipment to perform the service, you specify it on the '''Resource Equipment''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form by selecting it from the list in the lookup box of the '''Equipment''' column of this tab. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Resource_Equipment|Resource Equipment].
==Specifying Attendees==
If you want to add information about the customer&rsquo;s employees who are going to attend appointments that take place in rooms of your company branch location, make sure that the '''Enable Attendees''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form. With this check box selected, the '''Attendees''' tab is available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form, and you can specify such information about the customer's employees as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers.[anchor|#_fc2a1da9-8a34-4457-8f65-aab0ec60b16d]
==Specifying Attributes==
To give users the ability to specify additional properties that your organization wants to track related to service orders, attributes can be defined for the related service order type on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form. The attributes specified for a service order type are also used for appointments and service schedules of the type. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Order_Types#_27957a1a-ff98-4359-88b0-ff600f3387d0|Specifying Attributes for Service Orders, Appointments, and Service Contract
        Schedules].{br}

The system populates the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form with the active attributes (and default values, where applicable) defined for the selected service order type. You can specify or modify the attribute values for the service order in the '''Values''' column. If the '''Required''' check box is selected for an attribute, the value has to be specified before you save a new service order.{br}

For appointments created for a particular service order, the listed attributes and their values on this tab will be copied to the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form when the appointment is created.
==Viewing Service Orders==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_40_03_00|Service Order History] ([~/?ScreenId=FS400300|FS400300]) form to view all service orders entered into the system in the selected period of time and to find particular service orders. Also, you can sort service orders by your company branch, branch location, customer, and customer location.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Service Order Entry You enter orders that represent the services your company delivers to the customers. A         service order is a document that provides the general information on the services that will         be provided and the appointments that will take place.          In this topic, you will read about how to enter a service order into the system and specify         the necessary information. Entering a Service Order In general, you start your work with the service order by the entering the service order on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form. First, you select the type of service         order. For details, see  Service Order Types. After you select the service order type, you specify the following information: The customer and its location (and optionally, the attendees of the appointment from             the customer's company) Your company's branch and its location (and if the appointments occur there, the room             or rooms where the appointments take place) The date and time information of the service order The services that are included in this service order Optional: The staff members that perform the services of the order Optional: The appointments that are going to take place to deliver these services if             any (for details, see  Appointment Creation) Optional: Any included inventory items and resource equipment Optional: The values of the attributes for the service order By default, the system assigns a new service order the  Open  status. Reference         numbers for new orders are generated according to the numbering sequence assigned to the         service order type in the  Numbering Sequence  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form. If the service order is not ready to be performed yet, you can place it on hold by         selecting the  Hold  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders         form. With this check box selected, the status of the service order is  On Hold . A         service order with this status can be edited, saved, or taken off hold. If needed, you can use quotes as templates for repeating service orders for a particular         customer. In this case, you create service orders by copying the quotes. For details on         creating and copying quotes, see  Quote Processing. Specifying Date and Time Information The Summary area  of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form includes the            Date  box, where you should specify the date when the services has         been ordered by the customer. By default, for each service order, the date of service order         creation is filled in with the current business date. In the  Service Order Settings  tab on the            Settings  tab, you also can specify the approximate date when the         service order will be completed in the  Promised Date  box, and the         deadline date and time before which the service order has to be completed in the            SLA  box. Specifying Services You specify services that your company provides for the service order on the            Services  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders form. To do         this, you click the  Service Selector  button on the table toolbar, and         select the services included in this order from the list in the  Service           Selector  dialog box. The list, which can be filtered by service class,         contains all services that you have entered into the system. For details on services and         service classes, see  Services and  Service Classes. Alternatively, you can add each service by clicking  Add Row  and         manually selecting the service in the  Service ID  column of the         row. Assigning Staff Members For each service your company provides to the customer, you assign a staff member with the         appropriate skills and licenses to deliver the service. In general, you assign staff members         while you are planning the time of an appointment by using calendar boards. In this case,         you can filter staff members by the skills and licenses needed for each service, and you         plan the time when appointments will take place according to the work schedules and         availability of staff members. For details, see  Appointment Scheduling Options. Alternatively, you can assign staff members on the  Services  or            Staff  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders form by clicking         the  Staff Selector  button and selecting the staff member from the         list in the  Staff Selector  dialog box. In the  Staff           Selector  dialog box, the needed skills and license types specified for the         service are already selected for it, and the system filters the list of staff members,         showing only staff members who match the selection criteria. In this case, you do not take         into consideration the work schedule of the staff member when selecting the appropriate         staff member; this method of assigning staff members is convenient when it is not necessary         to make an appointment for the service order. If the  Enable Attendees  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types form for the selected service order type, you can assign         multiple staff members to perform one service. Otherwise, you can assign only one staff         member to each service. Specifying Inventory Items If your company provides services that may include selling items to the customer, you can         specify these items on the  Inventory Items  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders form. (All the necessary inventory items must be created on the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form before you add them to a service order.)         For details on stock items, see  Inventory Items. Specifying Resource Equipment If the staff member needs special equipment to perform the service, you specify it on the            Resource Equipment  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders form         by selecting it from the list in the lookup box of the  Equipment          column of this tab. For details, see  Resource Equipment. Specifying Attendees If you want to add information about the customer's employees who are going to attend         appointments that take place in rooms of your company branch location, make sure that the            Enable Attendees  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form. With this check box selected, the            Attendees  tab is available on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders         form, and you can specify such information about the customer's employees as their names,         email addresses, and phone numbers. Specifying Attributes To give users the ability to specify additional properties that your organization wants to         track related to service orders, attributes can be defined for the related service order         type on the  Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types         (FS202300) form. The attributes specified for a service order type are also used for         appointments and service schedules of the type. For details, see  Specifying Attributes for Service Orders, Appointments, and Service Contract
        Schedules. The system populates the  Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form with the active attributes (and default values,         where applicable) defined for the selected service order type. You can specify or modify the         attribute values for the service order in the  Values  column. If the            Required  check box is selected for an attribute, the value has to         be specified before you save a new service order.

In Acumatica ERP, ''allocation'' is a broad term used to denote splitting the item quantity into smaller quantities with different subitems or lot numbers, splitting the quantity into separate units with serial numbers, or specifying quantities that should be reserved for the order in different warehouses. This helps your company to avoid overstocks and stockouts of items being sold.((({S:Hint}The field services functionality does not support processing of stock items of lot/serial class with the ''When Used'' assignment method.
)))
In this topic, you will read about allocating stock items for service orders and allocating stock items that have been purchased for service orders.{br}{TOC}
==Allocation of Stock Items for Service Orders==
You can reserve the specified item quantities for the service order by allocating them on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form. On the '''Inventory Items''' tab, you can click a service order line and view the item availability information at the bottom of the form. You may want to reserve the requested quantity for this specific item (or for multiple items). {br}

To allocate stock for a particular line of a service order, you use the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens if you click the needed line on the '''Inventory Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form and then click '''Allocations''' on the table toolbar. By using this dialog box, you can select whether to reserve the requested quantities of the item in a single warehouse or multiple warehouses. If subitems are used in your system, you can split the item quantity between the available subitems. Also, you can use the '''Allocations''' dialog box to track the order fulfillment. For each allocation line, the '''Related Document''' column contains the reference number of the document related to the current stage of the order fulfillment. For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Allocate_Items_for_Service_Orders|To Allocate Items for a Service Order].((({S:Hint} If the ordered items are out of stock at the shipping warehouse but available at other warehouses, you can allocate the items in other warehouses, and fulfill the order through any number of transfer orders from other warehouses.
)))
==Notes on Processing of Appointments with Allocated Items==
With allocations for each inventory item line, the system will not allow a staff member to assign more units of an inventory item to an appointment than the quantity of units specified in the related service order. For example, suppose that one service and two units of the ''ACINF21'' inventory item are associated with a service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form. Two appointments are created to fulfill the service order, and each appointment has one unit of the ''ACINF21'' inventory item assigned. Suppose that during the second appointment, the customer asks for a third unit of the ''ACINF21'' inventory item. The system will not allow the staff member to modify the quantity of the line associated with the two original ''ACINF21'' inventory items because the appointment quantity would be greater than the service order quantity. In this case, the staff member needs to add a new line item to the second appointment for the extra ''ACINF21'' inventory item on the '''Inventory Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. The system will add the line item to the service order as well.{br}

 If a user clones an appointment that includes inventory items, if the quantity of inventory items in all appointments exceeds the quantity specified in the related service order, the system automatically adds new items to the service order.{br}

If the scheduler has added inventory items to a service order, and then not all inventory items have been used in the appointments associated with the service order, and if the billing cycle is set to generate invoices from appointments, when the service order is closed, the system cancels the allocation of the quantity of inventory items that were not used in appointments. ((({S:Hint}[anchor|#_4e33475e-0bec-401a-9242-d44ec3566457]
*If a user uncloses this service order, the system will not reallocate the inventory items that had not been assigned to any appointment.
*After a sales order document is generated for a service order or appointment, if a user deletes the sales order, the system allows the user to reopen the appointment or service order, modify it, and generate the sales order again. These actions do not cause the system to automatically reallocate the inventory items in the appointment or service order.
)))
==Allocation of Purchased Stock Items for Service Orders==
If the ordered items are out of stock at the shipping warehouse, you can process a purchase from a vendor for the subsequent sale to get the sufficient quantity of ordered items directly for this service order. For information on purchasing items for service orders, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_PO_Integration|Integration of Purchase Orders and Service Orders].{br}

After receipts have been released for the related purchase orders, you can track the stage of fulfillment for each line of the original sales order by clicking '''Allocations''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form. In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, which opens, you can view the allocation that the system automatically performs to reserve the line item quantity required for the service order on the purchase receipt. In the '''Allocations''' dialog box, you can also view the reference numbers of the related documents in the '''Related Documents''' column: the purchase order and the receipt. (You can click any reference number of a related document to view the document.){br}

If a purchase order for an inventory item was created from a service order, after the inventory item is received, the inventory item is automatically allocated for the service order. Additionally, if a serial number was specified in the purchase receipt, the serial number is copied to the service order.
==Item Availability Tracking==
The way the order quantity is reflected in the system depends on the availability calculation rule selected for the item class (of each included item) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. For details on availability, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Availability_Calculation|Availability Calculation]. {br}

Generally, as the status of a purchase order for a service order changes, the purchase order quantity updates the '''FS Prepared''', '''FS Booked''', '''FS Allocated''', and '''On Hand''' total quantities, which are reflected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form.

If subitems are used in your system, you can split the         item quantity between the available subitems. Also, you can use the            Allocations  dialog box to track the order fulfillment. For each         allocation line, the  Related Document  column contains the reference         number of the document         r elated         to the current stage of the order fulfillment.  For instructions, see            To Allocate Items for a Service Order.  If the ordered items are out of stock at the shipping warehouse but available at other         warehouses, you can allocate the items in other warehouses, and fulfill the order through         any number of transfer orders from other warehouses. Notes on Processing of Appointments with Allocated Items With allocations for each inventory item line, the system will not allow a staff member to         assign more units of an inventory item to an appointment than the quantity of units         specified in the related service order. For example, suppose that one service and two units         of the  ACINF21  inventory item are associated with a service order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form.

In the  Allocations  dialog box, which opens, you can view the         allocation that the system automatically performs to reserve the line item quantity required         for the service order on the purchase receipt. In the  Allocations          dialog box, you can also view the reference numbers of the related documents in the            Related Documents  column: the purchase order and the receipt. (You         can click any reference number of a related document to view the document.) If a purchase order for an inventory item was created from a service order, after the         inventory item is received, the inventory item is automatically allocated for the service         order. Additionally, if a serial number was specified in the purchase receipt, the serial         number is copied to the service order. Item Availability Tracking The way the order quantity is reflected in the system depends on the availability calculation     rule selected for the item class (of each included item) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes     (IN201000) form. For details on availability, see  Availability Calculation.  Generally, as the status of a purchase order for a service order changes, the purchase order     quantity updates the  FS Prepared ,  FS Booked ,       FS Allocated , and  On Hand  total quantities, which     are reflected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) ]]></column>

You use a quote to show a customer what services and costs will be involved if the customer orders the services of your company. Quotes contain the main information on orders and can be used as templates for future service orders if the customer wants to use your company&rsquo;s services.{br}

In this topic, you will read about creating quotes and processing them further in the system.
==Creating Quotes==
Before you start creating quotes, you must create a service order type with the ''Quote'' behavior on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form. {br}

You can then create a quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form by selecting a service order type with the ''Quote'' behavior and specifying the following information for the service order, as described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Creation|Service Order Entry]: [anchor|#_acfe97c2-b3e1-4325-bb04-e85135a948f7]
*The customer and its location
*The company&rsquo;s branch and its location (and optionally, the room at the branch location where the appointments take place)
*The date and time information of the service order
*The services that are provided for this service order
*Optional: The included inventory items
{br}

When you save a new quote, the system assigns it the ''Quote'' status and generates a reference number for it according to the numbering sequence assigned to the service order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form.{br}

You can place a quote that you have created on hold by selecting the '''Hold''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form if the quote is not ready yet. With this check box selected, the status of the quote is ''On Hold''. A quote with this status can be edited, saved, or taken off hold.{br}

Once they have been created, quotes can be printed and sent to customers. For details on how to print a quote, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Print_Service_Order|To Print a Service Order or Quote].
==Copying Quotes==
After you copy a quote to a service order, a new service order with the ''Open'' status is created in the system, and you can further process the service order, as described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Order_Processing|Service Order Processing Workflow]. The quote you copied remains in the system without changes. For details on how to copy a quote, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Convert_Quote_to_Service_Order|To Copy a Quote].{br}

Because you can copy the information on quotes to service orders, quotes can be used as templates for repeating orders with the same service information for a particular customer.

Depending on the invoicing settings of the billing cycle or cycles assigned to a customer, you can generate an invoice for each appointment or for each service order. For details on specifying billing cycles, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Billing_Cycle|Billing Cycle Settings].{br}

In this topic, you will read about how to generate invoices if the billing cycle assigned to the customer has been configured to generate invoices from service orders.((({S:Hint}[anchor|#_593ef22b-b715-408d-b84e-82dd5209d2aa]

*After you generate a billing document for a service order, you cannot add services, non-stock items, or stock items to the service order or to the related appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form.
)))
==Generation of Invoices for a Particular Service Order==
You generate a billing document, which is generally an Accounts Receivable invoice or a sales order of the ''Invoice'' type (for which an invoice can later be generated), for a particular service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form. If the service order for which you want to generate a billing document is not yet closed, you first have to click '''Actions''' > '''Allow Invoice'''. When you invoke this action, the system selects the '''Allow Invoice''' check box on the '''Other Info''' tab. {br}

You generate the document by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Generate Invoice'''. When you generate an invoice for the service order, the system selects the '''Invoiced''' check box on the '''Other Info''' tab and inserts the details of the generated document on the same tab. These details include the number of the batch in which the billing document has been generated, the type of the document and its reference number, and the reference number of the invoice associated with the document (if the invoice has been generated).{br}

For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Invoice_By_Service_Order#_5bd4b5c3-5870-4483-8d05-9551177eb057|To Generate a Billing Document for a Particular Service Order].
==Generating Invoices for Multiple Documents==
You can generate billing documents for multiple service orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_06_00|Generate Invoices from Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500600|FS500600]) form. On this form, to list the appointments for which you may want to generate billing documents, you select the functional area where the documents will be created (which is based on the invoice generation settings of the service order type of the service orders). ((({S:Hint}If the '''Service Order''' option button is selected under '''Generate Invoices From''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form for the billing cycle, to make the system display the service orders for which you want to generate invoices, you have to invoke the '''Allow Invoice''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form.
)))
You then specify the date of document creation, select all listed appointments or service orders for which you want to generate invoices (unless you are processing all listed documents), and generate the documents. If you are generating sales orders (that is, if ''Sales Orders'' is selected in the '''Generate Invoices In''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_06_00|Generate Invoices from Service Orders] form), you can specify the actions to be performed on the invoices related to the generated sales orders. You can set up the system to prepare invoices, release them, send emails to customers with the invoices, or to process prepared invoices by using the quick processing configured for sales orders. For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Invoice_By_Service_Order#_32ddeb5b-b732-45ae-bb05-6a17f53b6356|To Generate Billing Documents for Multiple Service Orders].[anchor|#_316e76b7-3855-4448-9d1b-a0c6160b9122]
==Creating Batches==
When you generate the billing documents, the system creates the documents in the selected functional area and creates a batch of generated documents on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_58_00|Invoice Generation Batches] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305800|FS305800]) form. The system assigns the batch a reference number in accordance with the numbering sequence assigned to batches in the '''Posting Batch Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form. {br}

To view information on the batch, you click the batch number in the '''Batch Nbr.''' column on the form where the generation process took place. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_58_00|Invoice Generation Batches] form with the batch. On this form, you can find the billing cycle, the invoice date, the posting module, the customer, the branch, and the document, service order, and appointment numbers.[anchor|#_4c1b06da-cf06-4722-8da8-6db696124180]
==Processing Documents==
The appropriate employees can process the generated documents in the functional area where the documents were created based on your organization&rsquo;s policies and processes. To open a generated document for the selected batch, you click the document number in the '''Document Nbr.''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_58_00|Invoice Generation Batches] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305800|FS305800]) form, which brings up the document on the applicable form, and then process it in the system. For details on processing these documents, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_InvoicesMemos|Processing Invoices], [HelpRoot_Financials\AP__con_AP_Bills_Processing|Entry of Bills], and [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_SO_Invoicing|Invoice Preparation].

In Acumatica ERP, you can process the service orders and appointments of the type for which quick processing has been configured with just one click.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the quick processing of service orders and appointments.{br}{TOC}
==Launching Quick Processing for a Service Order==
If the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices from service orders—that is, the '''Service Orders''' option button is selected in the '''Generate Invoices From''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form for the billing cycle—after quick processing is configured for a particular service order type, you can run quick processing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form. {br}

On the form toolbar of this form, the '''Quick Process''' button appears for a service order of this type. When you click this button for a service order with the status other than ''On Hold'', the system opens the '''Process Service Order''' dialog box. In this dialog box, before you quick-process the service order, you can change the settings related to the following actions:[anchor|#_ec831878-86e3-4e71-ae15-4231293d5b71]
*The actions performed on the service order, such as completing and closing the order and generating a sales order to perform billing of the customer.
*If a sales order is generated for the service order, the actions to be performed on the sales order, such as preparing an invoice for the sales order, sending an email with the sales order to the customer, or setting up the system to process the sales order (of the order type based on the ''IN'' order template only) by the quick processing defined for the sales order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. 
*If an invoice should be prepared for the generated sales order, the actions to be performed on this invoice—that is, whether to release the invoice and send an email with it to the customer.

After reviewing the processing details, you click '''OK''' in the dialog box to launch quick processing of the service order. For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Quickly_Process_Service_Order|To Quickly Process a Service Order].
==Launching Quick Processing for an Appointment==
If the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices from appointments—that is, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected in the '''Generate Invoices From''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form for the billing cycle—after quick processing is configured for a particular service order type, you can run quick processing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form. {br}

On the form toolbar of this form, the '''Quick Process''' button appears for an appointment of this type after the appointment has been completed. When you click this button for an appointment, the system opens the '''Process Appointment''' dialog box.

The needed skills for performing the service are selected automatically by the                     system based on the list of skills assigned to the service on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS400800|FS400800]) Services (FS203300) form. The needed license types for performing the service are selected automatically                     by the system based on the list of license types assigned to the service on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=FS400800|FS400800]) Services form. You should ensure that the selected person is available to perform services on                     the planned date and time by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board                     (FS300400) or   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form. ]]></column>

With the field services functionality of Acumatica ERP, you can process and track services that customers of your company have ordered. You can use two types of documents in the system when processing orders: service order and appointment. A service order document represents general information on the services that will be provided and the appointments that will take place. An appointment document represents one in-person meeting to perform one service or multiple services included in a service order.{br}

 This chapter describes general appointment processing steps available in Acumatica ERP.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Processing Appointments With the field services functionality of  Acumatica ERP, you can process and track services that customers of your company have ordered. You can use two types of documents in the system when processing orders: service order and appointment. A service order document represents general information on the services that will be provided and the appointments that will take place. An appointment document represents one in-person meeting to perform one service or multiple services included in a service order.  This chapter describes general appointment processing steps available in  Acumatica ERP.

In Acumatica ERP, you can control the steps required to process the appointments related to your company&rsquo;s service orders, from creating them to closing them and generating invoices.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the general workflow of processing appointments.{br}{TOC}
==Understanding the Workflow==
In general, the processing of an appointment consists of the following steps (for simplicity, one appointment with one staff member assigned is described):[anchor|#_95273f87-7884-4f40-990a-8a301b9baca7]
#Creating the appointment: The scheduler or service manager (that is, the person responsible for planning the time of the staff members who perform services) enters the service order and the related appointment into the system, adds additional information, and assigns the appropriate staff member to the appointment. The appointment is ready to be attended. 
#Starting the appointment: The staff member attending the appointment looks at his or her work schedule and prepares to attend the appointment. At the appointment location, the assigned staff member starts the appointment, performs services, and adds to the system additional information (such as stock items purchased by the customer as part of the service), if necessary.
#(Optional) Entering a prepayment: The staff member receives a prepayment from the customer and enters it to the system.
#Completing the appointment: After all the work on the appointment is done and all information is entered in the system and checked, the staff member specifies that all the work is finished and completes the appointment in the system.
#Closing the appointment: An accountant verifies the information on completed appointments, such as quantities and prices, and closes the verified appointments.
#Generating an invoice for the customer (if the customer&rsquo;s billing cycle settings indicate that invoices should be generated by appointment): An accountant generates invoices for the closed appointments and processes them in the system. For details on how to bill the customer for provided services, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Invoices|Generation of Billing Documents from Service Orders].
{br}

After each step has been performed, you can notify the customer and the staff member about appointment details by sending them notification emails. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Notify_Customer|To Send a Notification Email to a Customer] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Notify_Staff|To Send a Notification Email to a Staff Member]. Before an appointment has been assigned, you can also send notification emails to staff members of the service area where the appointment takes place, as described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Notify_Geo_Staff|To Send a Notification Email to Staff Members of a Service Area ].{br}

Also, during each step of the appointment processing, you can print the details of the appointment. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Print_Appointment|To Print an Appointment].{br}

For details on how to create an appointment and bill the customer for provided services, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Appointments|Appointment Creation] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Invoices|Generation of Billing Documents from Service Orders].{br}

The following sections provide detailed information about starting, completing, and closing appointments. 
==Starting an Appointment==
When a service member attends an appointment, the employee starts the appointment in the system and specifies the actual date and start time of it. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment]. {br}

Once a service member starts the appointment, it gets the ''In Process'' status. During the appointment, the employee manually changes the status of services that are performed to ''In Process'', services that are completed to ''Completed'', and services that are not going to be provided to ''Canceled''.
==Completing an Appointment==
After all services have been completed for an appointment, the staff member specifies the actual time when the services were completed and makes sure all needed information is entered for the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form. If all necessary works for appointments have been performed, the staff member selects the '''Finished''' check box and completes the appointment on the form. For details on how to complete an appointment, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

Once the appointment has been completed in the system, it gets the ''Completed'' status. You can reopen the completed appointment and change the appointment details.
==Closing an Appointment==
After the accounting information (prices and quantities of services) entered for the appointment has been checked by the applicable employee (such as a service manager) and the completed appointment is ready to be invoiced, this employee closes the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. Once an appointment is closed, changes cannot be made to it, and it gets the ''Closed'' status. For details on how to close a appointment, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment].
==Canceling an Appointment==
If a appointment with the ''Not Started'' status is not going to take place for any reason, you can cancel the appointment in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. Once you cancel an appointment, it gets the ''Canceled'' status. For details on how to cancel a appointment, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Cancel_Appointment|To Cancel an Appointment]. If you later determine that the canceled appointment will take place, you can reopen it.
==Reopening an Appointment==
If you have accidentally completed an appointment in the system that is not completed yet, or if a canceled appointment is going to take place, you can reopen the appointment (which has the ''Completed'' or ''Canceled'' status) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. Once you reopen an appointment, it gets the ''Not Started'' status, its information can be edited, and it can be further processed in the system. For details on how to reopen an appointment, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Reopen_Appointment|To Reopen an Appointment].
==Unclosing an Appointment==
If you have already closed an appointment and now you need to change any information on it, you can unclose the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. Once you unclose an appointment, it gets the ''Completed'' status, and its information can be edited. For details on how to unclose a appointment, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Unclose_Appointment|To Unclose an Appointment].

In Acumatica ERP, you can create appointments for each service order. An appointment is a document that contains information on a visit by staff members with the customer to perform services ordered from your company. {br}

In this topic, you will read about how to enter an appointment into the system and specify necessary information.{br}{TOC}
==Creating an Appointment==
You create an appointment in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form. Depending on the business processes in your company, you open this form at one of the following stages:[anchor|#_65838e73-cf6c-49be-9b98-41ae453f387c]
*When the service order has been created in the system already and you want to schedule the appointment based on the schedule of staff members on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form. For an appointment created in this way, you have to check the information that was copied to the created appointment from the service order. The copied information is the service order type, customer information, and branch information. If you have assigned services, stock items, staff members, and resource equipment, this information is also copied to the appointment. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Scheduling|Appointment Scheduling Options].
*When you are creating the service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form and you also want to create an appointment. For an appointment created at this stage, you have to specify only the scheduled date and time information in the appointment document; the other information is automatically inserted from the service order. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Appointment|To Create an Appointment Related to a Service Order].
*When the service order does not yet exist in the system. In this case, to create the appointment, you go directly to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form and enter all necessary information for the appointment. After you save the appointment, a new service order will be created in the system automatically. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Quick_Appointment|To Create an Appointment Without a Service Order]. 
*:((({S:Hint}You cannot create an appointment without service order if a manual numbering sequence is assigned to the service order type related to the appointment. In this case, you either create a service order first or set the automatic numbering sequence for the service order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form.
)))
{br}

You can instead use an already-created appointment as a template for other appointments of a particular service order. In this case, you create appointments by cloning existing appointments. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Clone_Appointment|To Clone an Appointment].{br}

By default, new appointments are saved in the system with the ''Not Started'' status. Reference numbers for appointments are generated based on the reference number of the related service order and the sequence number of the appointment created for this service order (''1'' for the first appointment, ''2'' for the second, and so on). For example, if the service order has the reference number ''000001'' in the system and you create the first appointment for this service order, the reference number of the appointment will be ''000001-1''. {br}

If the appointment is not ready to be attended yet, you can place it on hold by selecting the '''Hold''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. With this check box selected, the status of the appointment is ''On Hold''. An appointment with this status can be edited, saved, or taken off hold.
==Specifying Appointment Details==
In general, the following information should be specified in an appointment:[anchor|#_147b64f4-c20d-48cb-9899-e626ae860627]
*The customer and its location (and optionally, the attendees of the customer&rsquo;s company who participate in the appointment)
*Your company&rsquo;s branch and its location (and if the appointment occurs there, the room where the appointment takes place)
*The date and time information of the appointment
*The services that are performed during this appointment
*The staff members that perform services during this appointment
*The included inventory items and resource equipment
*Optional: The values of the attributes for the appointment
{br}

For details on how to specify services, staff members, and inventory and equipment information, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Creation|Service Order Entry].{br}

To specify date and time information for the appointment, in the '''Scheduled Date and Time''' section on the '''Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form, specify the scheduled date and the start and end time of the appointment. On the calendar boards, you can view the scheduled dates and times of appointments entered into the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Viewing_Appointments|Appointment Inquiry].
==Specifying Attributes==
To give users the ability to specify additional properties that your organization wants to track for appointments, attributes can be defined for the related service order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form. The attributes specified for a service order type are also used for service orders and service schedules of the type. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Order_Types#_27957a1a-ff98-4359-88b0-ff600f3387d0|Specifying Attributes for Service Orders, Appointments, and Service Contract
        Schedules].{br}

If an appointment is created from a service order, the system populates the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form with the attributes (and their values, if applicable) specified for the service order on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form. You can specify or modify the values of these attributes for the appointment.{br}

If the service order is created before its appointments, the attributes of the related appointments are initially inherited from the service order, but the values of each appointment&rsquo;s attributes are independent from the values of the attributes of the service order and from other appointments of the service order. For example, suppose that the ''PROBLEMTYPE'' attribute is among the attributes listed for the service order type. When a user creates a service order of the service order type, further suppose that this user defines the value of the ''PROBLEMTYPE'' attribute as ''Leaking''. When he or she creates the related appointment, the ''PROBLEMTYPE'' attribute has the default value of ''Leaking''; however, this value can be overwritten for any appointment related to the service order. During the execution of the appointment, if the staff member modifies the attribute of that appointment to ''Fuse'', the system does not modify this value for the related service order.{br}

If you first create an appointment and service order has not yet been created for it, on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, the system lists the attributes (and their values. if any default values have been specified) that have been specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] form for the selected service order type. You can specify or modify the values of these attributes for the appointment. If the '''Required''' check box is selected for an attribute, the value has to be specified before you save a new appointment. When you save the appointment, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form, the system creates the related service order, and the system populates the '''Attributes''' tab with the attributes defined for the appointment.

Depending on the business processes in your company, you open this form at one of the     following stages: When the service order has been created in the system already and you want to schedule the       appointment based on the schedule of staff members on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board       (FS300300) form or the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board (FS300400) form. For an appointment       created in this way, you have to check the information that was copied to the created       appointment from the service order. The copied information is the service order type, customer       information, and branch information. If you have assigned services, stock items, staff       members, and resource equipment, this information is also copied to the appointment. For       details, see  Appointment Scheduling Options. When you are creating the service order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100)       form and you also want to create an appointment. For an appointment created at this stage, you       have to specify only the scheduled date and time information in the appointment document; the       other information is automatically inserted from the service order. For details, see  To Create an Appointment Related to a Service Order. When the service order does not yet exist in the system. In this case, to create the       appointment, you go directly to the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form and enter       all necessary information for the appointment. After you save the appointment, a new service       order will be created in the system automatically. For details, see  To Create an Appointment Without a Service Order.  You cannot create an appointment        without service order if a manual numbering sequence is assigned to the service order type        related to the appointment. In this case, you either create a service order first or set the        automatic numbering sequence for the service order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form. You can instead use an already-created appointment as a template for other appointments of a     particular service order. In this case, you create appointments by cloning existing     appointments. For details, see  To Clone an Appointment. By default, new appointments are saved in the system with the  Not Started  status.     Reference numbers for appointments are generated based on the reference number of the related     service order and the sequence number of the appointment created for this service order      ( 1  for the first appointment,  2  for the second, and so on). For example, if the     service order has the reference number  000001  in the system and you create the first     appointment for this service order, the reference number of the appointment will be       000001-1 .  If the appointment is not ready to be attended yet, you can place it on hold by selecting the       Hold  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form. With this     check box selected, the status of the appointment is  On Hold . An appointment with this     status can be edited, saved, or taken off hold. Specifying Appointment Details In general, the following information should be specified in an appointment: The customer and its location (and optionally, the attendees of the customer's company who       participate in the appointment) Your company's branch and its location (and if the appointment occurs there, the room where       the appointment takes place) The date and time information of the appointment The services that are performed during this appointment The staff members that perform services during this appointment The included inventory items and resource equipment Optional: The values of the attributes for the appointment For details on how to specify services, staff members, and inventory and equipment     information, see  Service Order Entry. To specify date and time information for the appointment, in the  Scheduled Date and      Time  section on the  Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form, specify the scheduled date and the start and end time of the     appointment. On the calendar boards, you can view the scheduled dates and times of appointments     entered into the system. For details, see  Appointment Inquiry. Specifying Attributes To give users the ability to specify additional properties that your organization wants to     track for appointments, attributes can be defined for the related service order type on the        ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form. The attributes specified for a service order     type are also used for service orders and service schedules of the type. For details, see  Specifying Attributes for Service Orders, Appointments, and Service Contract
        Schedules. If an appointment is created from a service order, the system populates the       Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form     with the attributes (and their values, if applicable) specified for the service order on the       Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form.     You can specify or modify the values of these attributes for the appointment. If the service order is created before its appointments, the attributes of the related     appointments are initially inherited from the service order, but the values of each     appointment's attributes are independent from the values of the attributes of the service order     and from other appointments of the service order. For example, suppose that the       PROBLEMTYPE  attribute is among the attributes listed for the service order type. When a     user creates a service order of the service order type, further suppose that this user defines     the value of the  PROBLEMTYPE  attribute as  Leaking . When he or she creates the     related appointment, the  PROBLEMTYPE  attribute has the default value of  Leaking ;     however, this value can be overwritten for any appointment related to the service order. During     the execution of the appointment, if the staff member modifies the attribute of that appointment     to  Fuse , the system does not modify this value for the related service order. If you first create an appointment and service order has not yet been created for it, on the       Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form,     the system lists the attributes (and their values. if any default values have been specified)     that have been specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types form for the selected service     order type. You can specify or modify the values of these attributes for the appointment. If the       Required  check box is selected for an attribute, the value has to be     specified before you save a new appointment. When you save the appointment, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders form, the system creates the related service order, and the system     populates the  Attributes  tab with the attributes defined for the     appointment.

In this topic, you will read about ways you can use the various calendar boards for scheduling.{br}{TOC}
==Appointment Scheduling Options==
When you schedule appointments, you decide what time each appointment is going to happen, and which staff members of your company will attend the appointment. During scheduling, you can take into account staff members&rsquo; skills, licenses, and geographical location.{br}

While viewing a service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form, you can schedule appointments for performing services by clicking one of the following commands in the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar:[anchor|#_d847304f-4ecc-4f30-9c28-644fe7c6dea4]
*'''Schedule on the Calendar Board'''
* '''Schedule on the Staff Calendar Board'''
* '''Schedule on the Room Calendar Board'''
{br}

Also, if you have a service order created in the system for a particular customer, while viewing that customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form, you can schedule appointments for that customer by clicking one of the following commands on the '''Actions'''menu on the form toolbar:[anchor|#_6bbfc33f-892a-4e92-ada0-cedab178a6c4]
*'''Schedule on the Calendar Board'''
* '''Schedule on the Staff Calendar Board'''

==Calendar Board==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form, you see the work schedules of the staff members of your company. To select the right staff members to perform services, you can filter staff members by any needed skills, license types, services, and service areas related to the service for which you want to schedule an appointment. Based on the available working times of staff members, you decide who will perform services and when, assign selected staff members, and create appointments. For appointments that are already created, you can assign staff members to perform them.{br}

For details on how to perform scheduling, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].
==Staff Calendar Board==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, you see the work schedule of a particular staff member of your company. To assign this staff member to services he or she can perform, you can filter service orders and appointments by any of the following: skills, license types, and service classes related to this staff member. Based on the available working times of the staff member, you decide which services, service orders, or appointments this staff member will perform and when, assign the staff member to these, and create any needed appointments. 
==Room Calendar Board==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_07_00|Room Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300700|FS300700]) form, you see the availability of the rooms in your company's branch location. Based on this information, you select which services will be performed in which room of the selected branch location and when, and you create any needed appointments. (If appointments are already created, you just assign a room to them.) Rooms are usually used for internal service orders (that is, those for which the services are performed at your company location).((({S:Hint}To be able to use rooms for services, you must have the '''Enable Rooms''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form.

In Acumatica ERP, if you sell stock and non-stock items during appointments, you can track the item costs and profitability. You can use this information for future planning, budgeting, forecasting, and performance reporting.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how you can track the costs of the items involved in appointments and how to view total cost and profitability of a particular appointment.{br}{TOC}
==Tracking Stock Item Costs and Profitability==
You can view the cost and profitability of a particular stock item that is sold during the appointment on the '''Profitability''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form. When you add a line item of the ''Inventory Item'' type to the '''Inventory Items''' tab of the form, on the '''Profitability''' tab, the line item is also added with the average cost—that is, the cost specified in the '''Average Cost''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for the item—inserted into the '''Unit Cost''' column.{br}

If the stock item was part of a purchase order, and the unit cost was overwritten in the '''Unit Cost''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form in the related service order, this cost is inserted into the '''Unit Cost''' column on the '''Profitability''' tab.{br}

When this stock item is removed from inventory (that is, when the related issue is released), the system updates this column with the cost specified in the '''Unit Cost''' column on the '''Transaction Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form in the related issue. 
==Tracking Non-Stock Item Costs and Profitability==
You can view the cost and profitability of a particular non-stock item that is sold during the appointment on the '''Profitability''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form. When you add a line item of the ''Non-Stock Item'' type to the '''Services''' tab of the form, on the '''Profitability''' tab, the line item is also added with the current cost—that is, the cost specified in the '''Current Cost''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form for the non-stock item—in the '''Unit Cost''' column.{br}

If this non-stock item was part of a purchase order and the unit cost was overwritten in the related service order, this cost is inserted in the '''Unit Cost''' column on the '''Profitability''' tab.
==Tracking Appointment Total Cost and Profitability==
In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, you can view the total cost of items included in an appointment in the '''Cost Total''' box. The value in this box is calculated as the sum of values in the '''Cost Total''' column on the '''Profitability''' tab.{br}

In the Summary area, you can also view the total profitability (in percent) of the selected appointment in the '''Profit (%)''' box. The system calculates the value in this box by using the following formula:{{{{ ((Appointment Total – Cost Total) / Cost Total) * 100
}}}}
For example, if the '''Appointment Total''' is $2000 and the '''Cost Total''' is $1500, then the total profitability of the appointment is 33,33%.

In Acumatica ERP, you can track the labor costs (that is, the amounts paid to the employee for the job) for the staff members that attend appointments. {br}

In this topic, you will read about how the system calculates the labor costs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Calculation of Labor Costs==
When you assign a staff member to attend an appointment, the line item for the staff member is also added on the '''Profitability''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form with the hourly rate specified in the '''Unit Cost''' column. The system copies this rate from the '''Hourly Rate''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form for the staff member.((({S:Hint}The system calculates the labor cost for a staff member for an appointment only if the ''Employee'' or ''Labor Item'' labor rate type and the ''Hourly'' type of employment are assigned to the staff member on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] form.
)))
When the appointment is completed, the system calculates the total cost of performing the job by each staff member ('''Cost Total''') by multiplying the values in the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Unit Cost''' columns on the '''Profitability''' tab. Thus, you can see how much has been paid to each staff member that attended the appointment.

The system calculates the labor cost for a staff member for an appointment only if the            Employee  or  Labor Item  labor rate type and the  Hourly  type of         employment are assigned to the staff member on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) Labor Cost Rates         form. When the appointment is completed, the system calculates the total cost of performing the         job by each staff member ( Cost Total ) by multiplying the values in         the  Actual Quantity  and  Unit Cost  columns on         the  Profitability  tab. Thus, you can see how much has been paid to         each staff member that attended the appointment.  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) ]]></column>

The time that staff members spend on attending appointments or performing services can be reported automatically on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_70_00|Employee Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]) form. If a staff member works during the entire appointment or a part of the appointment, the appointment time is registered in the time activity. If a staff member performs only particular services of the appointment, the service time is registered in the time activity of the staff member.{br}

In this topic, you will read about configuring the system to make this integration possible, registering appointment staff time, registering service staff time, and updating appointments and time activities.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Tracking of Time Activities for Staff Members==
To make the system automatically create the applicable time activities for staff members on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_70_00|Employee Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]) form when appointments are completed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, you should configure the system as follows:[anchor|#_9e88d4d1-ba0b-4d10-b55e-d156922577bd]
#You ensure that the ''Time Reporting on Activity'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
#You ensure that the required settings are specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form.
#You select the '''Enable Time & Expenses Integration''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form.
#For each service order type for which time activities should be created, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, you make sure that the '''Automatically Create Time Activities from Appointments''' check box is selected, and you select the default earning type to be used for the hours spent performing the appointments in the '''Default Earning Type''' box.
#:((({S:Hint}You can also define an earning type for each service in the '''Service Management''' section of the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_40_08_00|Services] ([~/?ScreenId=FS400800|FS400800]) form. The earning type for the service would have a higher priority than the default earning type for the service order type.
)))
#For each staff member to perform services, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form, you verify that the '''Linked Entity''' box is filled with the user login name.

==Registration of Staff Time for the Entire Appointment ==
For all staff members that work during the entire duration of an appointment, to track the staff time, you assign these staff members to the appointment but do not associate them with any service. That is, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, you assign the necessary staff members to the appointment on the '''Staff''' tab and leave the '''Service ID''' column empty for these staff members.{br}

When the staff member performs the appointment, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form (the '''Actual Date and Time''' section of the '''Summary''' tab), he or she enters the time when the appointment has started in the '''Actual Start Time''' box and the time when the appointment has ended in the '''Actual End Time''' box. For details on processing appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Appointment_Processing|Appointment Processing Workflow].{br}

When the appointment is completed (that is, when a staff member invokes the '''Complete Appointment''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form), the system copies the appointment times from the '''Actual Start Time''' and '''Actual End Time''' boxes of the '''Summary''' tab to the '''Actual Start Time''' and '''Actual End Time''' boxes of the '''Staff''' tab. {br}

The system also automatically creates a time activity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_70_00|Employee Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]) form for each staff member assigned to the appointment. The '''Start Time''' of the time activity is the '''Actual Start Time''' of the staff member on the '''Staff''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. The '''Time Spent''' of the time activity is the difference between the '''Actual End Time''' and '''Actual Start Time''' of the staff member on the '''Staff''' tab.
==Registration of Staff Time for a Part of the Appointment ==
If a staff member is working on the appointment only during a specific part of the appointment but not during the entire appointment, to correctly track the staff time, you assign the applicable staff members to the appointment but do not associate them with any service. That is, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, you assign the necessary staff members to the appointment on the '''Staff''' tab and leave the '''Service ID''' column empty for these staff members.{br}

When the staff member performs the appointment, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form (the '''Actual Date and Time''' section of the '''Summary''' tab), he or she enters the time when the appointment has started in the '''Actual Start Time''' box, the time when the appointment has ended in the '''Actual End Time''' box, and the actual time he or she has worked in the '''Actual Duration''' box on the '''Staff''' tab. For details on processing appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Appointment_Processing|Appointment Processing Workflow].{br}

When the appointment is completed (that is, when a staff member invokes the '''Complete Appointment''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form), the system copies the appointment times from the '''Actual Start Time''' box of the '''Summary''' tab to the '''Actual Start Time''' box of the '''Staff''' tab and calculates '''Actual End Time''' as a sum of the actual start time and duration. {br}

The system also automatically creates a time activity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_70_00|Employee Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]) form for each staff member assigned to the appointment. The '''Start Time''' of the time activity is the '''Actual Start Time''' of the '''Staff''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. The '''Time Spent''' of the time activity is the difference between the '''Actual End Time''' and '''Actual Start Time''' of the staff member on '''Staff''' tab.
==Registration of Service Staff Time==
If a staff member is working on the appointment during only particular services (or one service) but not during all services, to correctly track the staff time, you associate the staff member with the services he or she is performing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form. You can assign a staff member to a service line in the following ways: [anchor|#_7323650c-1952-42b7-8cd3-deeba92e5aa9]
*If the service is performed by only one staff member, by selecting this staff member in the '''Staff Member ID''' column of the service line on the '''Services''' tab
*By clicking the service line and then clicking the '''Staff Selector''' button on the '''Services''' tab and selecting the staff member in the '''Staff Selector''' dialog box
*By clicking the '''Staff Selector''' button on the '''Staff''' tab, selecting a service line in the '''Service Line Ref.''' box, and selecting the staff member in the '''Staff Selector''' dialog box
*By selecting the service line reference number in the '''Service Line Ref.''' column on the '''Staff''' tab for the staff member 

During the appointment, on the '''Services''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form, staff members should enter the actual start and end times of particular services in the '''Actual Start Time''' and '''Actual End Time''' columns, respectively.{br}

When the appointment is completed (that is, when a staff member invokes the '''Complete Appointment''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form), the system automatically creates the time activity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_70_00|Employee Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]) form for each staff member assigned to the appointment. If the staff member is assigned to one service, the '''Start Time''' of the time activity is the '''Actual Start Time''' of the service performed by the staff member on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form; the '''Time Spent''' of the time activity is the '''Actual Duration''' of the service. If the staff member is assigned to multiple services, the '''Time Spent''' of the time activity is the sum of the actual durations of the services.
==Actions that Invoke Automatic Updates of Time Activities==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, you can correct appointments, which causes the existing employee time activity records to be updated accordingly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_70_00|Employee Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]) form. The system automatically makes corresponding updates to time activities under the following circumstances:[anchor|#_626bc4cf-d675-496e-ba65-2f6740cc858f]
*When you change the staff member who performed a service or the entire appointment on the '''Staff''' tab. In this case, the system deletes the time activity of the previous staff member and adds a new time activity for the newly selected staff member.
*If time was recorded for the entire appointment or a part of the appointment, when you change the start and end times in the '''Actual Start Time''' and '''Actual End Time''' columns of the '''Staff''' tab of the related staff member. Under these circumstances, in the time activity, the system updates the start time and the time spent.
*If time was recorded for any service, when you change the start and end times in the '''Actual Start Time''' and '''Actual End Time''' columns of the '''Services''' or '''Staff''' tab. In this case, in the time activity, the system updates the actual duration of the service and the time spent by the staff member.
*When you clear the '''Track Time''' check box on the '''Staff''' tab. This action causes the system to delete the time activity record. If you select this check box again, the system will add the time activity record.
*When you reopen the appointment. In this case, the system deletes all time activity records. The records will again be created when the appointment is completed.

If the staff member is assigned to one service, the  Start           Time  of the time activity is the  Actual Start Time  of         the service performed by the staff member on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form; the            Time Spent  of the time activity is the  Actual           Duration  of the service. If the staff member is assigned to multiple services,         the  Time Spent  of the time activity is the sum of the actual         durations of the services. Actions that Invoke Automatic Updates of Time Activities On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form, you can correct appointments, which         causes the existing employee time activity records to be updated accordingly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]) Employee Time Activities (EP307000) form.

In this case, the system deletes the time activity           of the previous staff member and adds a new time activity for the newly selected staff           member. If time was recorded for the entire appointment or a part of the appointment, when you           change the start and end times in the  Actual Start Time  and              Actual End Time  columns of the  Staff  tab           of the related staff member. Under these circumstances, in the time activity, the system           updates the start time and the time spent. If time was recorded for any service, when you change the start and end times in the              Actual Start Time  and  Actual End Time            columns of the  Services  or  Staff  tab. In           this case, in the time activity, the system updates the actual duration of the service and           the time spent by the staff member. When you clear the  Track Time  check box on the              Staff  tab. This action causes the system to delete the time           activity record. If you select this check box again, the system will add the time activity           record. When you reopen the appointment. In this case, the system deletes all time activity           records.

If needed, you can override this default value. In the  Service Order Type  box, if you have selected                      a                      service order type that has the  Internal  behavior specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form, the                          Customer  and  Location  boxes                     are not available to be filled in. The  Project  box appears on the form only if the                          Project Accounting  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features(CS100000)                      form.

Note the following about the  Settings  tab: The                      Scheduled Date and Time  section is not available for                 editing if a service order type                  with                  the  Route  behavior specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types form is                 selected in the  Service Order Type  box.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[Suppose that a customer has requested particular services from your company. The request is received and entered into Acumatica ERP by a sales manager of your company. Further processing is then performed by the scheduler, the assigned staff members, and the accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes them in the system. 
In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the customer&rsquo;s request in the system.{br}{TOC}
== Processing a Service Request==
In this example, settings are applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By'''). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].
*For the service order type, on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, the applicable service order type is configured as follows:
**In the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section, the option button to create sales orders ('''Sales Order''' under '''Generate Invoices In''') is selected.
**In the '''General Settings''' section, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Completed''' check box is selected, so that service orders of the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed. Also, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Closed''' check box is selected, meaning that service orders of the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed.
{br}

Also, stock items are necessary to perform the services (they are purchased by the customer as part of performing the service), so they are added to the service order by the sales manager. An extra item was necessary during the appointment, so it was added to the appointment in the system by the staff member who handled the appointment.{br}

In the diagram below, you can see the entire service request process.[anchor|#_3f62d5b6-17f9-46cf-a9a3-7d55dba48a14][anchor|#_6d1c7616-0f48-4b5b-982b-926b3018b1bf][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Service_Request.png|popup|Service request processing|320px]
==Entering a Service Order==
When a sales manager receives a customer request for services, he or she enters a quote (that is, a service order with the ''Quote'' behavior) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the quote, the sales manager specifies the customer from which the request has been received, the branch and branch location where the services are delivered, the services that should be performed, and the inventory items to be purchased with the service. The sales manager then prints the quote and sends it to the customer for confirmation. For details on how to create and print a quote in the system, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_SO|To Create a Service Order] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Print_Service_Order|To Print a Service Order or Quote].{br}

After the customer has approved the quote, the sales manager copies the quote to a service order with the ''Open'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form (2 in the diagram). Staff members can be assigned to the service order and appointments can be created. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Convert_Quote_to_Service_Order|To Copy a Quote].
==Creating Appointments==
After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (3) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer. {br}

When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks information on each appointment and enters additional information (4), such as the resource equipment used to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the service. (The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to the created appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].
==Attending an Appointment==
The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend (5), and goes to the location where the service has to be performed (usually it is the customer location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form (6). (The appointment gets the ''In Process'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds information on services (such as status, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form (7). When the services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member selects the '''Finished''' check box and completes the appointment (8), which gives it the ''Completed'' status, and the system completes the service order. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.
==Closing the Appointments and Service Order==
Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] form, the accountant opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices (9). When all information is verified and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments (10), and the system closes the service order. (The appointments and service order get the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].
==Processing Invoices==
The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (11). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].{br}

The accountant then process the sales order in the system.]]></column>

Also, the  Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Closed  check box is selected, meaning that service orders of                         the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed. Also, stock items are necessary to perform the services (they are purchased by the customer         as part of performing the service), so they are added to the service order by the sales         manager. An extra item was necessary during the appointment, so it was added to the         appointment in the system by the staff member who handled the appointment. In the diagram below, you can see the entire service request process. Service request processing Entering a Service Order When a sales manager receives a customer request for services, he or she enters a quote (that         is, a service order with the  Quote  behavior) by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the quote,         the sales manager specifies the customer from which the request has been received, the         branch and branch location where the services are delivered, the services that should be         performed, and the inventory items to be purchased with the service. The sales manager then         prints the quote and sends it to the customer for confirmation. For details on how to create         and print a quote in the system, see  To Create a Service Order and  To Print a Service Order or Quote. After the customer has approved the quote, the sales manager copies the quote to a service         order with the  Open  status on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders form (2 in the         diagram). Staff members can be assigned to the service order and appointments can be         created. For details, see  To Copy a Quote. Creating Appointments After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is,         a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form to schedule the appointments (3) that are         needed to perform the services requested by the customer.  When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into         consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff members         by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the         services are provided. The scheduler checks information on each appointment and enters         additional information (4), such as the resource equipment used to perform the services and         the stock items purchased by the customer along with the service. (The system assigns the            Not Started  status to the created appointments.) For details on scheduling         appointments, see  To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board. Attending an Appointment The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming         appointments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board (FS300400) form, identifies which         appointment he or she has to attend (5), and goes to the location where the service has to         be performed (usually it is the customer location). When the staff member starts to perform         the service, he or she starts the appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments         (FS300200) form (6). (The appointment gets the  In Process  status.) For details,         see  To Start an Appointment. While the services are being performed, the staff member adds information on services (such as         status, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form (7). When the services are done, the staff member checks         the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member         selects the  Finished  check box and completes the appointment (8),         which gives it the  Completed  status, and the system completes the service order. For         details, see  To Complete an Appointment. When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the         service order the  Completed  status. Closing the Appointments and Service Order Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board form, the accountant opens the completed appointment and         verifies quantities and prices (9). When all information is verified and the appointments         are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments (10), and the system closes         the service order. (The appointments and service order get the  Closed  status.) For         details, see  To Close an Appointment and  To Close Service Orders. Processing Invoices The accountant generates a sales order document with the  Open  status by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) Generate Invoices from Appointments (FS500100) form (11). For details, see  To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments. The accountant then process the sales order in the system. ]]></column>

A ''reactive call'' is a call from a customer informing your company of a problem with equipment that needs an urgent resolution. Suppose that the customer has reported a problem that occurred with equipment that your company sold (also referred to as ''target equipment''). The scheduler of your company plans the appointment and assigns a staff member to perform the service. The staff member attends the appointment and specifies necessary information, such as appointment duration and inventory items added on to the service. The accountant closes the appointment and generates a sales order to bill the customer.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the reactive call in the system.{br}{TOC}
==Processing a Reactive Call==
In this example, settings are applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By'''). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].
*For the service order type, on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, the applicable service order type is configured as follows:
**In the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section, the option button to create sales orders ('''Sales Order''' under '''Generate Invoices In''') is selected.
**In the '''General Settings''' section, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Completed''' check box is selected, so that service orders of the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed. Also, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Closed''' check box is selected, meaning that service orders of the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed.
{br}

Also, stock items are necessary to perform the services (they are purchased by the customer as part of performing the service), so they are added to the service order by the scheduler. An extra item was necessary during the appointment, so it was added to the appointment in the system by the staff member who handled the appointment.{br}

In the diagram below, you can see the entire reactive call process.[anchor|#_3f62d5b6-17f9-46cf-a9a3-7d55dba48a14][anchor|#_7df20fb6-416d-48e1-9b05-d04706259058][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Reactive_Call.png|popup|Reactive call processing|320px]
==Creating an Appointment==
A scheduler of your company receives a request that the customer has reported a problem. The scheduler finds the customer (see 1 in the diagram above) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form and plans an appointment with the customer. To do so, the scheduler navigates to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form, filters the staff according to the skills and licenses required to perform the service, and decides who will deliver the service (2 in the diagram). The scheduler clicks the '''Appointment''' button and creates an appointment (3) with the ''Not Started'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form. On the form, the scheduler indicates the time and assigns the staff member and any necessary inventory items expected to be included with the service. The service order is automatically created in the system with the ''Open'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Quick_Appointment|To Create an Appointment Without a Service Order].{br}

After the appointment is created, the scheduler sends notification emails to the customer and staff member (4). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Notify_Customer|To Send a Notification Email to a Customer] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Notify_Staff|To Send a Notification Email to a Staff Member].
==Attending the Appointment==
The staff member assigned to attend an appointment receives the email with the appointment details (5), studies the details, and goes to the customer location at the scheduled time. At the customer location, the staff member finds the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, opens the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form, and starts it (6). (The appointment gets the ''In Process'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds information on services (such as status, quantities, or extra inventory items that were used) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form (7). When the services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member selects the '''Finished''' check box and completes the appointment (8), which gives it the ''Completed'' status, and the system completes the service order. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status
==Closing the Appointments and Service Order==
After an appointment is completed, further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] form, the accountant finds and opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices (9). When all information is verified and the appointment is ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointment (10), and the system closes the service order. (The appointments and service order get the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].
==Processing Invoices==
The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (11). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].{br}

==Processing a Sales Order==
In this example, the settings are applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By'''). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].

In the diagram below, you see the entire processing of the sales order.[anchor|#_3f62d5b6-17f9-46cf-a9a3-7d55dba48a14][anchor|#_efb4aade-3261-4a7d-b2b7-4b1b4683453d][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Sales_Order_Integration.png|popup|Sales order processing along with a service order processing|450px]
==Entering a Sales Order==
When a sales manager receives a customer order, he or she enters the sales order with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the sales order, the sales manager specifies the customer from which the order has been received, adds the inventory items to be sold and shipped and services that should be performed. For details on creation of a sales order, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__How_Create_Sale_Order|To Create a Sales Order (SO)].{br}

After the sales order is created, the sales manager clicks '''Actions''' > '''Create Service Order''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form. In the '''Create Service Order''' dialog box, he or she enters a type of the service order. The system then opens the created service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form, on which the sales manager verifies the details and saves the service order. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Service_Order_from_Sales_Order|To Create a Service Order from a Sales Order].
==Creating an Appointment==
After the sales order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the '''Schedule on the Calendar Board''' action of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form to schedule the appointments that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) (3). When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and sorts the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed for performing the services and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on the appointment and enters additional information, such as the inventory items expected to be included with the service to be performed. (The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to the created appointments). For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].
==Attending an Appointment==
To attend an appointment, the staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend (4), goes to the location where the service has to be performed (usually it is the customer location), and starts the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form (5). (The appointment gets the ''In Process'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds information on services (such as status, quantities, or extra inventory items that were used) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form (6). When the services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member selects the '''Finished''' check box and completes the appointment (7), which gives it the ''Completed'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.
==Closing the Appointments and Service Order==
After the appointment is completed, further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] form, the accountant finds and opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the service order is ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments (8), and the system closes the service order. (The appointment and service order get the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].
==Generating Billing Documents==
The accountant generates a new sales order document with the ''Open'' status for the extra stock item that was used during the appointment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (9).

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Integration of Sales Orders and Service Orders A sales order document can be processed along with the service order as services                 (which were sold along with products) are being performed. Suppose that the customer                 has ordered some products of your company along with installation services for them.                 The sales order is received and entered into the system by a sales manager of your                 company. Then further processing is performed by the scheduler, the staff members                 assigned to the applicable service, and the accountant who prepares invoices for the                 customer and processes sales orders in the system.  Integration with field services has to be enabled for the sales order type so that                 users are able to create service orders from sales orders. That is, the                      Enable Field Services Integration  check box has to be                 selected for the necessary order type on the  General Settings                  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000) form. In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the sales order                 along with the service order. Processing a Sales Order In this example, the settings are applied in the system as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) Billing Cycles (FS206000) form, the billing                 cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by                 appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the  Appointments                  option button is selected under both  Generate Invoices From                  and  Group Invoices By ). For details, see  To Add a Billing Cycle and  To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer. For the service order type, on the  Preferences  tab of the                       ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form, the applicable                 service order type is configured as follows: In the  Invoice Generation Settings  section, the                         option button to create sales orders ( Sales Order                          under  Generate Invoices In ) is selected. In the  General Settings  section, the                              Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Completed  check box is selected, so that service orders of                         the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed.                         Also, the  Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Closed  check box is selected, meaning that service orders of                         the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed. Also, stock items are necessary to perform the services (they are purchased by the                 customer as part of performing the service), so they are added to the service order                 by the sales manager. An extra item was necessary during the appointment, so it was                 added to the appointment in the system by the staff member who handled the                 appointment.. In the diagram below, you see the entire processing of the sales order. Sales order processing along with a service order processing Entering a Sales Order When a sales manager receives a customer order, he or she enters the sales order with                 the  Open  status by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form                 (see 1 in the diagram above). In the sales order, the sales manager specifies the                 customer from which the order has been received, adds the inventory items to be sold                 and shipped and services that should be performed. For details on creation of a                 sales order, see  To Create a Sales Order (SO). After the sales order is created, the sales manager clicks  Actions Create Service Order  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form. In the  Create Service                     Order  dialog box, he or she enters a type of the service order. The system                 then opens the created service order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders                 (FS300100) form, on which the sales manager verifies the details and saves the                 service order. For details, see  To Create a Service Order from a Sales Order. Creating an Appointment After the sales order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company                 (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the                      Schedule on the Calendar Board  action of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form to schedule the appointments that are                 needed to perform the services requested by the customer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) (3). When the scheduler selects a staff                 member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work                 schedule of the staff member and sorts the displayed staff members by the skills and                 licenses needed for performing the services and the service area where the services                 are provided. The scheduler checks the information on the appointment and enters                 additional information, such as the inventory items expected to be included with the                 service to be performed. (The system assigns the  Not Started  status to the                 created appointments). For details on scheduling appointments, see  To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board. Attending an Appointment To attend an appointment, the staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks                 through his or her upcoming appointments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board                 (FS300400) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend (4), goes to                 the location where the service has to be performed (usually it is the customer                 location), and starts the appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments                 (FS300200) form (5). (The appointment gets the  In Process  status.) For                 details, see  To Start an Appointment. While the services are being performed, the staff member adds information on services                 (such as status, quantities, or extra inventory items that were used) to the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form (6). When the services are                 done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is                 correct and complete, the staff member selects the  Finished                  check box and completes the appointment (7), which gives it the  Completed                  status. For details, see  To Complete an Appointment. When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns                 the service order the  Completed  status. Closing the Appointments and Service Order After the appointment is completed, further processing of the service order is                 performed by an accountant. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board form, the                 accountant finds and opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and                 prices. When all information is verified and the service order is ready for                 invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments (8), and the system closes the                 service order. (The appointment and service order get the  Closed  status.) For                 details, see  To Close an Appointment and  To Close Service Orders. Generating Billing Documents The accountant generates a new sales order document with the  Open  status for                 the extra stock item that was used during the appointment by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) Generate Invoices from Appointments (FS500100) form (9). For details, see  To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments. The accountant then processes both sales orders in the system. For details, see  Processing Sales of Stock Items. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
A purchase order can be created from a service order if the necessary stock items are not at any of your company&rsquo;s warehouses, or if services or non-stock items are provided by vendor. {br}

For the use case to be considered in this topic, suppose that the customer has requested particular services from your company. The request is received and entered into Acumatica ERP by a service manager of your company, who has determined that stock items are needed for an appointment but are not available at any warehouse. Thus, purchase orders need to be created for the service order.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing of the service order along with purchase orders.((({S:Hint}In this topic, we consider only purchasing of stock items for a service order. Similarly, services or non-stock items can be purchased via service order in case if vendor provides non-stock item or services (at a vendor location).
))){br}{TOC}
==Applying the System Settings of the Use Case==
In this example, you have applied the following settings, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form:[anchor|#_e4250e60-b296-4b90-8a26-bc620b6adcb2]
*The '''Create Bill on Receipt Release''' check box is selected, so the system automatically creates a bill after a purchase receipt is released.
*The '''Release IN Documents Automatically''' check box is selected, so the system automatically creates an inventory receipt with the ''Released'' status after a purchase receipt is released.
*The '''Hold Receipts on Entry''' check box is selected, so new purchase receipts will have the ''On Hold'' status.

Also, you have selected the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form, so new documents will have the ''On Hold'' status.
==Processing a Service Order for Which Items Should Be Purchased==
In the diagram below, you can see the workflow of the service order being processed along with the purchase orders.[anchor|#_de2f2a31-218f-4c39-aea5-cf0b86e782a2][anchor|#_71e5bc98-5e57-4b3c-8637-fd11938bd565][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Integration_with_PO.png|popup|Purchase orders processing along with service order processing|450px]
==Entering a Service Order==
When a service manager receives a customer request for services, he or she enters a service order with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the service order, the sales manager specifies such details as the customer from which the request has been received, the branch and branch location from which the services are delivered, the services that should be performed, and the stock items to be purchased with the service. For details on how to create a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_SO|To Create a Service Order].{br}

As part of this step, the service manager checks the availability of the stock items at the warehouse (by clicking the lookup icon in the '''Warehouse''' column of the '''Inventory Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form for each item). For the inventory items that are not available at the warehouse, the manager selects the check box in the '''Mark for PO''' column (2). The system selects the '''Waiting for Purchased Items''' check box in the Summary area of the form indicating that at least one item in the service order needs to be received.
==Creating Purchase Orders==
After the service manager has made sure that all the necessary items are marked as needing to be purchased from the vendor, he or she opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form by invoking the '''Create Purchase Orders''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form. On this form, the manager checks the vendors and vendor locations specified for the items for which the purchase orders need to be created and processes them (3).{br}

The system creates purchase orders of the ''Normal'' type with the ''On Hold'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. Now the service manager can track the reference number and status of the purchase orders related to the service order in the '''PO Nbr.''' and '''PO Status''' columns on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_40_10_00|Service Order Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS401000|FS401000]) form.((({S:Hint}The system creates one purchase order for all items with the same vendor and vendor location, and different purchase orders for items with different vendors or vendor locations.
)))
==Processing Purchase Orders==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, the purchase manager processes the purchase orders (4), as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Purchase_Order_Processing|Purchase Order Creation]. The system assigns the ''Open'' status to the purchase order. (Each time the status of the purchase order is changed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, the status is reflected in the '''PO Status''' column on '''Inventory Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form.) {br}

Each time a receiving clerk receives the purchased stock items, he or she creates and processes a purchase receipt on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form (5). After purchase receipts have been released for all items included in the purchase order, the system assigns the purchase order the ''Closed'' status. The system also generates an inventory receipt with the ''Released'' status, which the receiving clerk can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. {br}

The system also creates a bill with the ''On Hold'' status. An accountant now can process bills related to the purchase orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form (6).
==Creating Appointments==
After the purchase order has been processed, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) then uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (7) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer.{br}

When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the services are provided. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, the scheduler checks the information on each appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used to perform the services. (The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to each appointment when it is first created.) For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].((({S:Hint}An appointment can be created earlier in the process. The items that need to be purchased will also be included in the appointment. The '''Mark for PO''', '''PO Nbr.''', and '''PO Status''' columns display details on the related purchase.
)))
==Processing the Service Order and Appointment==
The further processing workflow of the service order and its appointment does not differ from the general processing workflow of an ordinary service order. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Order_Processing|Service Order Processing Workflow].

In the service order, the sales manager specifies such         details as the customer from which the request has been received, the branch and branch         location from which the services are delivered, the services that should be performed, and         the stock items to be purchased with the service. For details on how to create a service         order, see  To Create a Service Order. As part of this step, the service manager checks the availability of the stock items at the         warehouse (by clicking the lookup icon in the  Warehouse  column of the            Inventory Items  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders form for         each item).          For         the inventory items  that are not available at the warehouse, the manager         selects the check box in the  Mark for PO  column (2). The system         selects the  Waiting for Purchased Items  check box in the Summary area         of the form indicating that at least one item in the service order needs to be received. Creating Purchase Orders After the service manager has made sure that all the necessary items are marked as needing         to be purchased from the vendor, he or she opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders         (PO505000) form by invoking the  Create Purchase Orders  action on the             ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form.

The system creates one purchase order for all items with the same vendor and vendor         location, and different purchase orders for items with different vendors or vendor         locations. Processing Purchase Orders On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form, the purchase manager processes         the purchase orders (4), as described in  Purchase Order Creation. The system assigns the  Open  status to the purchase order. (Each time the status         of the purchase order is changed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, the status is         reflected in the  PO Status  column on  Inventory           Items  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders form.)  Each time a receiving clerk receives the purchased stock items, he or she creates and         processes a purchase receipt on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form (5).         After purchase receipts have been released for all items included in the purchase order, the         system assigns the purchase order the  Closed  status. The system also generates an         inventory receipt with the  Released  status, which the receiving clerk can view on the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form.          The system also creates a bill with the  On Hold  status. An accountant now can         process bills related to the purchase orders on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments         (AP301000) form (6). Creating Appointments After the purchase order has been processed, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person         who is responsible for planning the appointments) then uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form to schedule the appointments (7) that are         needed to perform the services requested by the customer.

On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form, the         scheduler checks the information on each appointment and enters additional information, such         as the resource equipment used to perform the services. (The system assigns the  Not           Started  status to each appointment when it is first created.) For details on         scheduling appointments, see  To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board. An appointment can be created earlier in the process. The items that need to be         purchased will also be included in the appointment. The  Mark for PO ,            PO Nbr. , and  PO Status  columns display         details on the related purchase.

A customer case can be processed along with a service order while the services necessary to resolve the case are being performed. Suppose that the customer contact has complained about how some product (which was purchased from your company) works. The case is received and entered into the system by a support manager of your company. Then further processing is performed by the scheduler, the staff members assigned to perform the service, and the accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes them in the system. {br}

In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in the processing of the case along with the service order.{br}{TOC}
==Processing a Case==
In this example, the settings are applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By'''). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].
*For the service order type, on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, the applicable service order type is configured as follows:
**In the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section, the option button to create sales orders ('''Sales Order''' under '''Generate Invoices In''') is selected.
**In the '''General Settings''' section, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Completed''' check box is selected, so that service orders of the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed. Also, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Closed''' check box is selected, meaning that service orders of the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed.
{br}

Also, stock items are necessary to perform the services (they are purchased by the customer as part of performing the service), so they are added to the service order by the support manager. An extra item was necessary during the appointment, so it was added to the appointment in the system by the staff member who handled the appointment.{br}

In the diagram below, you can see the entire case processing process.[anchor|#_3f62d5b6-17f9-46cf-a9a3-7d55dba48a14][anchor|#_e75a90e0-f98e-452f-a0fe-95cfecf9374c][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Case_Integration.png|popup|Case processing along with service order processing|320px]
==Entering a Case==
The support manager enters a new case associated with the customer by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the case, the support manager specifies the business account (customer account) from which the case has been received, the contact person, and the details of the case; the manager saves the case with the ''Open'' status. For details on how to create a case, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__HOW_To_Create_a_Case|To Create a Case].{br}

The manager also invokes the '''Create Service Order''' action and specifies the service order type (2 in the diagram). He or she then adds the services (3) that need to be performed to the service order related to this case, which was automatically created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_Service_to_SO|To Add Services to a Service Order or Appointment].((({S:Hint}After the service order has been created for the case, you can create a task with the service associated with the case on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_20|Task] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306020|CR306020]) form. When you save the task, the system adds the service to the service order created for the case.
)))
==Creating Appointments==
After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (4) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer. When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and sorts the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each appointment and enters additional information, such as any inventory items expected to be included with the service to be performed. (The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to the created appointments). For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].
==Attending the Appointment==
To attend an appointment, the staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend (5), goes to the location where the service has to be performed (usually it is the customer location), and starts the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form (6). (The appointment gets the ''In Process'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds information on services (such as status, quantities, or extra inventory items that were used) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form (7). When the services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member selects the '''Finished''' check box and completes the appointment (8), which gives it the ''Completed'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.
==Closing the Case==
After the services have been completed, the support manager contacts the customer and confirms the resolution of the case. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form, the support manager closes the case in the system (9), and the system assigns the ''Closed'' status to the case.
==Closing the Appointments and Service Order==
After all appointments are completed, further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] form, the accountant opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments (10), and the system closes the service order. (The appointments and service order get the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].
==Processing Invoices==
The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (19). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].{br}

The accountant then process the sales order in the system.]]></column>

In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in the processing of the case  along         with the service order. Processing a Case In this example, the settings are applied in the system as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) Billing Cycles (FS206000) form, the billing                 cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by                 appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the  Appointments                  option button is selected under both  Generate Invoices From                  and  Group Invoices By ). For details, see  To Add a Billing Cycle and  To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer. For the service order type, on the  Preferences  tab of the                       ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form, the applicable                 service order type is configured as follows: In the  Invoice Generation Settings  section, the                         option button to create sales orders ( Sales Order                          under  Generate Invoices In ) is selected. In the  General Settings  section, the                              Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Completed  check box is selected, so that service orders of                         the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed.                         Also, the  Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Closed  check box is selected, meaning that service orders of                         the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed. Also, stock items are necessary to perform the services (they are purchased by the customer         as part of performing the service), so they are added to the service order by the support         manager. An extra item was necessary during the appointment, so it was added to the         appointment in the system by the staff member who handled the appointment. In the diagram below, you can see the entire case processing process. Case processing along with service order processing Entering a Case The support manager enters a new case associated with the customer by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases (CR306000) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the case, the         support manager specifies the business account (customer account) from which the case has         been received, the contact person, and the details of the case; the manager saves the case         with the  Open  status. For details on how to create a case, see  To Create a Case. The manager also invokes the  Create Service Order  action and         specifies the service order type (2 in the diagram). He or she then adds the services (3)         that need to be performed to the service order related to this case, which was automatically         created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form. For details, see  To Add Services to a Service Order or Appointment. After the service order has been created for the case, you can create a task with the         service associated with the case on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306020|CR306020]) Task (CR306020) form.         When you save the task, the system adds the service to the service order created for the         case. Creating Appointments After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that         is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form to schedule the appointments (4) that are needed         to perform the services requested by the customer. When the scheduler selects a staff member         to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff         member and sorts the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform         the service and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the         information on each appointment and enters additional information, such as any inventory         items expected to be included with the service to be performed. (The system assigns the            Not Started  status to the created appointments). For details on scheduling         appointments, see  To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board. Attending the Appointment To attend an appointment, the staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through         his or her upcoming appointments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board (FS300400) form,         identifies which appointment he or she has to attend (5), goes to the location where the         service has to be performed (usually it is the customer location), and starts the         appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form (6). (The appointment         gets the  In Process  status.) For details, see  To Start an Appointment. While the services are being performed, the staff member adds information on services (such         as status, quantities, or extra inventory items that were used) to the appointment on the             ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form (7). When the services are done, the staff member         checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff         member selects the  Finished  check box and completes the appointment         (8), which gives it the  Completed  status. For details, see  To Complete an Appointment. When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the         service order the  Completed  status. Closing the Case After the services have been completed, the support manager contacts the customer and         confirms the resolution of the case. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) Cases (CR306000)         form, the support manager closes the case in the system (9), and the system assigns the            Closed  status to the case. Closing the Appointments and Service Order After all appointments are completed, further processing of the service order is performed         by an accountant. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board form, the accountant opens the         completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified         and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments (10),         and the system closes the service order. (The appointments and service order get the            Closed  status.) For details, see  To Close an Appointment         and  To Close Service Orders. Processing Invoices The accountant generates a sales order document with the  Open  status by using the             ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) Generate Invoices from Appointments (FS500100) form (19). For details, see  To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments. The accountant then process the sales order in the system. ]]></column>

An opportunity, which is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, represents an actual revenue-generating opportunity with a customer or potential customer. For the opportunity, a quote, which represents a formal offer made to a particular customer based on the opportunity, can be created in the system.((({S:Hint}Quote functionality becomes available in the system if the ''Sales Quotes'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
For the use case to be considered in this topic, suppose that the customer has called and requested a proposal for some products of your company along with installation services for them. The opportunity is received and entered into the system by a sales manager of your company. The sales manager prepares a sales quote and sends it for review to the customer. After reviewing the proposal, the customer decides to procure the company for the services and products, so the opportunity has been won. Then further processing of the opportunity (and the other resulting documents and entities) is performed by scheduler, the staff members assigned to the applicable service, and the accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes sales orders in the system. {br}

In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the opportunity with sales quote along with processing the related service order.{br}{TOC}
==Applying the System Settings of the Use Case==
In this example, the configuration settings have been applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By'''). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].
*For the service order type, on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, the applicable service order type is configured as follows:
**In the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section, the option button to create sales orders ('''Sales Order''' under '''Generate Invoices In''') is selected.
**In the '''General Settings''' section, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Completed''' check box is selected, so that service orders of the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed. Also, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Closed''' check box is selected, meaning that service orders of the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed.
{br}

Also, stock items are necessary to perform the services (they are purchased by the customer as part of the services being performed), so they are added to the service order by the sales manager. 
==Processing an Opportunity with a Sales Quote Along with the Service Order==
In the diagram below, you can see the entire workflow of processing the opportunity and the related documents and entities in the system.[anchor|#_e6e87de1-f812-4d53-899f-0e716fb5073a][anchor|#_e160e8cd-6cee-415d-8b77-611a7cdaa64e][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Opportunities_with_Sales_Quotes_and_FS.png|popup|Opportunity processing along with service order processing|450px]
==Processing an Opportunity==
The sales manager enters a new opportunity associated with the customer by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the opportunity, the sales manager specifies the business account (customer account) associated with the opportunity, the contact person, and the details of the opportunity, including services and inventory items to be provided (on the '''Document Details''' tab). For details, see [HelpRoot_CRM\CR__HOW_To_Create_an_Opportunity|To Create an Opportunity].{br}

Then the sales manager prepares a sales quote (2 in the diagram) and after all the necessary information is added, sends it to the customer (3). When the customer accepts the offer, the sales manager creates a service order by invoking the '''Create Service Order''' action and specifying the service order type and branch location that will provide services in the '''Create Service Order''' dialog box (4).{br}

The system creates and opens the service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form, and checks that all the services that should be performed and the inventory items to be purchased are in the service order; adds items if necessary. 
==Creating an Appointment==
After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (5) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer. When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and sorts the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each appointment and enters additional information, such as any inventory items expected to be included with the service to be performed. The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to the created appointments. {br}

For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].
==Performing the Appointment==
The staff member assigned to attend an appointment receives the email with the appointment details, reviews the details, and goes to the customer location at the scheduled time. At the customer location, the staff member finds the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, opens the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, and reflects its start in the system (6). The appointment is assigned the ''In Process'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

When the services have been finished, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member selects the '''Finished''' check box and completes the appointment, which gives it the ''Completed'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.
==Closing the Appointments and Service Order==
After all appointments are completed, further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form, the accountant verifies the completed appointment. When all information is verified and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointment (7). This action causes the system to close the related service order and to assign the appointments and service order the ''Closed'' status.{br}

For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].
==Processing Invoices==
The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (8). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].{br}

The accountant then processes the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form (9).

Then further processing of the opportunity (and the     other resulting documents and entities) is performed by scheduler, the staff members assigned to     the applicable service, and the accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes     sales orders in the system.  In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the opportunity with sales     quote along with processing the related service order. Applying the System Settings of the Use Case In this example, the configuration settings have been applied in the system as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) Billing Cycles (FS206000) form, the billing                 cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by                 appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the  Appointments                  option button is selected under both  Generate Invoices From                  and  Group Invoices By ). For details, see  To Add a Billing Cycle and  To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer. For the service order type, on the  Preferences  tab of the                       ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form, the applicable                 service order type is configured as follows: In the  Invoice Generation Settings  section, the                         option button to create sales orders ( Sales Order                          under  Generate Invoices In ) is selected. In the  General Settings  section, the                              Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Completed  check box is selected, so that service orders of                         the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed.                         Also, the  Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Closed  check box is selected, meaning that service orders of                         the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed. Also, stock items are necessary to perform the services (they are purchased by the customer as     part of the services being performed), so they are added to the service order by the sales     manager.  Processing an Opportunity with a Sales Quote Along with the Service Order In the diagram below, you can see the entire workflow of processing the opportunity and the     related documents and entities in the system. Opportunity processing along with service order processing Processing an Opportunity The sales manager enters a new opportunity associated with the customer by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the opportunity, the     sales manager specifies the business account (customer account) associated with the opportunity,     the contact person, and the details of the opportunity, including services and inventory items     to be provided (on the  Document Details  tab). For details, see  To Create an Opportunity. Then the sales manager prepares a sales quote (2 in the diagram) and after all the necessary     information is added, sends it to the customer (3). When the customer accepts the offer, the     sales manager creates a service order by invoking the  Create Service      Order  action and specifying the service order type and branch location that will     provide services in the  Create Service Order  dialog box (4). The system creates and opens the service order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders     (FS300100) form, and checks that all the services that should be performed and the inventory     items to be purchased are in the service order; adds items if necessary.  Creating an Appointment After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is,     a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form to schedule the appointments (5) that are needed to     perform the services requested by the customer. When the scheduler selects a staff member to     attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member     and sorts the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service     and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on     each appointment and enters additional information, such as any inventory items expected to be     included with the service to be performed. The system assigns the  Not Started  status to     the created appointments.  For details on scheduling appointments, see  To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board. Performing the Appointment The staff member assigned to attend an appointment receives the email with the appointment     details, reviews the details, and goes to the customer location at the scheduled time. At the     customer location, the staff member finds the appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board     (FS300400) form, opens the appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form,     and reflects its start in the system (6). The appointment is assigned the  In Process      status. For details, see  To Start an Appointment. When the services have been finished, the staff member checks the details of the appointment.     When everything is correct and complete, the staff member selects the       Finished  check box and completes the appointment, which gives it the       Completed  status. For details, see  To Complete an Appointment. When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the     service order the  Completed  status. Closing the Appointments and Service Order After all appointments are completed, further processing of the service order is performed by     an accountant. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form, the accountant verifies     the completed appointment. When all information is verified and the appointments are ready for     invoicing, the accountant closes the appointment (7). This action causes the system to close the     related service order and to assign the appointments and service order the  Closed      status. For details, see  To Close an Appointment and  To Close Service Orders. Processing Invoices The accountant generates a sales order document with the  Open  status by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) Generate Invoices from Appointments (FS500100) form (8). For details, see  To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments. The accountant then processes the sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders     (SO301000) form (9).

Suppose that a customer has contacted your company to request particular services and stock items associated with these services. A sales manager receives the request and enters a service order for it into Acumatica ERP. The customer has also paid in advance for one part of the service order when requesting the services and items. The processing of the service order and prepayment is then performed by the scheduler, the assigned staff members, and the accountant. ((({S:Hint}The functionality of prepaying service orders and appointments is available only if the '''Sales Orders''' option button is selected under '''Generate Invoices In''' group on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form for the type of the service order or appointment.
)))
In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the customer&rsquo;s request in the system.{br}{TOC}
==Establishing Initial Configuration Settings ==
Before the processing of the service order with a prepayment (as presented in this example), configuration settings have been applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By'''). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].
*For the service order type, on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, the applicable service order type is configured as follows:
**In the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section, the option button to create sales orders ('''Sales Order''' under '''Generate Invoices In''') is selected.
**In the '''General Settings''' section, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Completed''' check box is selected, so that service orders of the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed. Also, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Closed''' check box is selected, meaning that service orders of the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed.

==Understanding the Process Workflow==
With these initial configuration settings established in the system, the service order (with prepayments and inventory items) is created and then processed, as described in the remainder of this topic. In the diagram below, you can see the entire process.[anchor|#_074885e5-014a-4590-a0b6-228f4144828c][anchor|#_97bf1457-0ead-4428-b832-d2def3136415][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Prepayments_for_Service_Orders_and_Appointments.png|popup|Processing a service order with prepayments|450px]
==Entering a Service Order and a Prepayment for It==
When the sales manager receives the customer request for services, he or she enters a service order with the ''Open'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form (see 1 in the diagram above); the sales manager adds the requested services to the '''Services''' tab. Stock items are necessary to perform the services (and were requested by the customer as part of performing the service), so the sales manager adds the items to the service order on the '''Inventory Items '''tab.{br}

While entering the service order, the sales manager also enters the prepayment from the customer into the system by clicking the '''Create Prepayment''' button on the table toolbar of the '''Prepayments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form, which opens, he or she enters the details of the prepayment (2 in the diagram). For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Prepayment_for_Service_Order|To Create a Prepayment for a Service Order].
==Creating Appointments==
After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (3) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer. The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to each created appointment.{br}

When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and by the service area where the services are provided. For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].
==Attending an Appointment==
The staff member who is assigned to an appointment views upcoming appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend now, and goes to the location where the service has to be performed (usually the customer location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form (4), which causes The appointment to be assigned the ''In Process'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

Suppose that at the appointment, the staff member receives a second prepayment from the customer and adds it to the system by clicking the '''Create Prepayment''' button on the table toolbar of the '''Prepayments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form, which opens, the staff member enters the details of the prepayment (5). For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Prepayment_for_Appointment|To Create a Prepayment for an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds information on these services (such as status, quantities, and extra stock items that were used beyond the items that were initially entered for the service order) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. When the staff member is done performing the services, he or she checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member selects the '''Finished''' check box in the Summary area and completes the appointment (6), which gives it the ''Completed'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.
==Closing the Appointments and Service Order==
After the appointment is completed, further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] form, the accountant finds and opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified, the accountant closes the appointments and the service order (7). (The appointment and service order are assigned the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].
==Processing Billing Documents==
The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (8). The generated sales order includes information on the prepayments on the '''Payments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. For instructions on generating invoices from appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].((({S:Hint}Prepayments are associated with service orders. If users generate sales order from appointments, the prepayment is applied in accordance with the order in which sales orders are generated for the associated appointments. Suppose a service order has two appointments. A customer made a prepayment during the first appointment. If the sales order for the second appointment is generated first, the prepayment is applied to the sales order of the second appointment. If the billable amount of the appointment is less than the prepayment amount, the remaining amount will be applied to the sales order generated for the first appointment.
)))
The accountant then processes the sales order.

By using the equipment management functionality, you can maintain and track information about the equipment that your company uses to provide services or for which your company provides services. For frequently maintained equipment, you can create service contracts in which you can add schedules of customer visits and set the specific billing period for the customer. With the integration between the equipment management functionality and the service management functionality of Acumatica ERP, you can process service orders and appointments related to contracts of equipment maintenance. {br}

You use equipment management functionality to perform a variety of procedures related to managing equipment, which are briefly described in the following sections of this topic.{br}{TOC}
==Integrating the Equipment Management Module with Other Modules==
From the Equipment Management module, you can generate service orders or appointments in the Service Management module according to schedules of service contracts or create them on-the-fly for service contracts with the standardized billing.{br}

If a customer post pays for the contracts services, you generate billing documents in an appropriate module depending on the settings of the Service Management module. The following options are available:[anchor|#_93934a70-513c-4090-a6a8-147c4ad3ce39]
*Generating documents in the Accounts Receivable or Accounts Payable module (only if the documents are generated for service order or appointment)
*Generating documents in the Sales Orders module

The documents are further processed in the respective modules and post financial transactions to the General Ledger module. In the following figure, you can see the flow of documents from the Equipment Management module for the post-paid contracts.[anchor|#_367e0cb3-a122-4b96-95df-21e788767340][anchor|#_9e9d4f22-f7c0-42df-a4ad-ba06e22a4a44][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Document_Flow_EM.png|popup|Document flow from Equipment Management (as Performed Billing)|300px]
If a customer pays for the contracts services according to standardized billing, you generate billing documents in an appropriate module depending on the settings of the Equipment Management module. The generating of documents in the following modules is available: Accounts Receivable or Sales Orders. The documents are further processed in the respective modules and post financial transactions to the General Ledger module. In the following figure, you can see the flow of documents from the Equipment Management module for the contracts with the predefined billing.[anchor|#_0eb30e07-ddbf-46c7-8edf-4d9210240f10][anchor|#_95ac8a68-7dad-40c0-b99a-f674e4513c22][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Document_Flow_EM_Standardized_Billing.png|Document flow from Equipment Management (as Performed Billing)|300px]
==Managing and Tracking Equipment==
You can enter, maintain, and track information on the equipment that is involved in the service delivery process. In Acumatica ERP, equipment is divided into two major categories, resource equipment and target equipment, based on how the equipment is related to the service. Resource equipment is a resource of your company that is used to perform services, while target equipment is serviced by your company. In the system, you can easily track the resource equipment used during appointments, keep information and arrange appointments for maintenance of target equipment.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can track the serial numbers of equipment after it is sold. You can track the warranties, upgrades, and all other pertinent information for the equipment by using its serial number. You can also track the service history for the equipment, including every part that has been added to it. The system also supports tracking multiple serial numbers for the same equipment and tracking serial numbers for different components. An unlimited number of serial numbers can be tracked.{br}

For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Equipment_chapter|Managing Equipment].
==Processing Service Contracts==
In Acumatica ERP, you can create service contracts with the following two types of billing: the billing for a service contract is performed after the appointments were attended based on what was done during the appointment (that is, ''as performed'' billing) or the billing is performed based on what is covered by the contract at the end of the billing period (that is, ''standardized billing''). {br}

With the Equipment Management, you can create and manage multiple schedules of equipment service delivery for each customer. By using schedules, you generate service orders or appointments in Service Management. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Processing_ServiceContracts|Processing Service Contracts].
==Other Processes==[anchor|#_d607187c-bd0f-45e1-98b7-77a0d12f0e6e]

This topic describes the process of implementing the equipment management functionality in Acumatica ERP. In this topic, you will read about the preparation stage and the actual implementation of the Equipment Management functional area. {br}{TOC}
==Prerequisites and Dependencies==
[anchor|#_009215d4-54cf-42f7-b651-d6f984f5fbe0]
#The license for Acumatica ERP should include the ''Equipment Management'' feature. The feature should be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Managing_Features|Managing Features].
#The initial system configuration must be completed and the General Ledger module and Service Management must be configured before you implement the Equipment Management module. The Equipment Management module can be tightly integrated with the Inventory module. This module does not require any change in its configuration when the Equipment Management module is implemented; however, the module to be integrated with the Equipment Management module should be implemented first.

==Preparation==
Before you begin the basic configuration of the Equipment Management module, you develop numbering rules (which will later determine how the autonumbering sequences are configured) for equipment.
==Configuration of Numbering Sequences==
To start using the Equipment Management module, you need to define the numbering sequence for equipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form, and then select this numbering sequence in the '''Equipment Numbering Sequence''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form. The selected numbering sequence is automatically assigned in the '''Equipment Numbering Sequence''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_03_00|Equipment Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100300|FS100300]) form.
==Configuration of Warranty Calculation==
Also, you should select specify how the system determines the start date for the calculation of warranty periods on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_03_00|Equipment Management Preferences] form. You select one of the option buttons under '''Calculate Warranty From''' as follows:[anchor|#_94f48f69-03a7-40c3-b003-ca5de1736854]
*If the warranty period is calculated from the sales date of the equipment or component, you select the '''Sales Order Date''' option button. The date of the sales order document is used as the start date of the warranty period.
*If the warranty period is calculated from the installation date of the equipment or component, you select the '''Appointment Date''' option button. The actual date of the appointment is used as the start date of the warranty period.
*If the warranty period is calculated from the earliest date between the sales date and the installation date, you select the '''The Earliest of Both Dates''' option button.
*If the warranty period is calculated from the latest date between the sales date and the installation date, you select the '''The Latest of Both Dates''' option button.
[anchor|#_f3e82e76-f315-48e2-aecf-e2d8df20afa8]
==Configuration of Invoice Generation Settings==
For standardized billing service contracts, in the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section, you have to specify the module in which the invoices are generated. You do one of the following under '''Generate Invoices In''':[anchor|#_f493e210-947d-429b-b3fc-ef2776697a87]
*If you need to generate invoices for service contracts with services only, you select the '''Accounts Receivable''' option button. With this option selected, you can manage receivables and automate customer invoicing and payment collection in the Accounts Receivable module.
*If you need to generate invoices for service contracts with both services and inventory items that were sold to customers along with the services, you select the '''Sales Orders''' option button. With this option selected, you can create shipments if needed and add additional freight costs in the Sales Orders module.
*If you need to generate invoices for service contracts with both services and inventory items that were sold to customers along with the services but you do not need to create shipments and add additional freight costs, you select the '''SO Invoice''' option button.

When you have selected the module, you specify the default settings for it (also in the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section) to be used in the invoice documents.{br}

To configure the system to automatically activate the next period when an invoice is generated for the previous one, you select the '''Activate Upcoming Period on Invoice Generation''' check box.

A ''service template'' is a set of services and inventory items that is used to create service contract schedules. Using service templates helps to reduce the time that would be spent entering the service data into the contract when the appropriate user creates the schedule.{br}

In this topic, you will read about creating service templates in the system and adding them to a contract schedule.
==Creating a Service Template==
You can create a service template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_49_00|Service Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=FS204900|FS204900]) form. On this form, you enter the identifier of the template, the description, the service order type, and you add the services (and any stock items) that will be used with this template. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Service_Template|To Create a Service Template].{br}

You can use the service templates when you schedule service contracts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) form.
==Adding Service Templates to a Schedule==
To speed up the process of adding services and inventory items to the service contract schedule, on the '''Services''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) form, you add an appropriate service template by selecting ''Service Template'' in the '''Line Type''' column and selecting the service template in the '''Service Template ID''' column.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form, you can view the services, service templates, and inventory items that were added to the schedules of a particular contract on the '''Services''' and '''Inventory Items''' tabs. You can also view the prices of the services and the stock items of the contract on the '''Service Prices''' and '''Inventory Item Prices''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] form, respectively.

In Acumatica ERP, you can enter and maintain information about manufacturers and the equipment that they produce. Once you create a manufacturer in the system, you can specify it for any piece of equipment that is added to the system. Also, for any piece of equipment, you can specify the related manufacturer model. The details specified for manufacturers and their models are used for informational purposes only; no specific functionality in the system is associated with this information.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how manufacturers are created and assigned to equipment in the system.
==Adding Manufacturers==
When you create equipment in the system, you can select any manufacturer defined in the system. You define a manufacturer that produces equipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_44_00|Manufacturers] ([~/?ScreenId=FS204400|FS204400]) form. When you define the manufacturer, you specify its address and main contact information, such as the identifier of the contact person, the contact's email address, and the contact's phone and fax numbers. For details on how to add a manufacturer, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_a_Manufacturer|To Add a Manufacturer].{br}

You can assign manufacturers to new and existing equipment. For each manufacturer, you can also add its model information to the system.
==Adding Manufacturer Models==
A ''manufacturer model'' is equipment that is produced by a specific manufacturer. In Acumatica ERP, you can add a manufacturer model on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_48_00|Manufacturer Models] ([~/?ScreenId=FS204800|FS204800]) form. On this form, you specify the manufacturer, the identifier of the model, and its description. You can also assign to the model an equipment type defined in the system. For details on how to add a manufacturer model to the system, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_a_Model|To Add a Manufacturer Model].{br}

After you have entered the model, you can assign it to appropriate equipment. 
==Assigning a Manufacturer and Model to Equipment==
You assign a manufacturer and its model to equipment in the '''Manufacturer Info''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form. You select the manufacturer of the equipment in the '''Manufacturer''' box, and you associate the manufacturer model with the equipment in the '''Manufacturing Model''' box.

In Acumatica ERP, you can enter equipment types, which are categories that are used for grouping equipment and associating a group of equipment with a service. You create equipment types, specify the appropriate type for each resource or target equipment, and assign equipment types to services. These steps ensure that the right equipment will later be selected to perform these services.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how equipment types are created and assigned to services in the system.
==Creating Equipment Types==
Equipment types structure the data in the system and make it easier to select the right equipment for performing services. Equipment of one equipment type is used for similar types of work. For instance, if your company provides installation services, you might create the first equipment type for all drills of the company and the second equipment type for screwdrivers. You create equipment types on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_08_00|Equipment Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_Equipment_Type|To Add an Equipment Type].{br}

If you need to specify properties for the equipment of the type beyond those tracked by predefined settings, you can add a list of attributes for the equipment type. When equipment of the equipment type is created in the system, the user specifies the values of these attributes.{br}

Once you have created the equipment types, you can assign them to the appropriate resource or target equipment (for details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Resource_Equipment|Resource Equipment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Target_Equipment|Target Equipment]) and to services (as described in the section below). {br}

You can also specify an equipment type for a manufacturer model; for details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Manufacturers|Manufacturers]. (No specific functionality is associated with this assignment.)[anchor|#_5903681c-4c3c-417e-af0b-d127f27487b7]
==Setting Up Attributes for Equipment Type==
To give users the ability to specify additional properties (that is, attributes) that your organization wants to track for equipment of a particular type, you list those attributes and their settings on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_08_00|Equipment Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) form. The active attributes you define for the equipment type are listed for equipment of this type on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00_2|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form.((({S:Hint}On this tab, you can select attributes only if they have already been defined in the system. If you need an attribute that is not defined in the system, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form to create the attribute. Then you will be able to select the new attribute for any equipment type. 
))){br}

You can specify whether each attribute of the equipment type is required. When creating a piece of equipment of the type, a user must specify values for all the required attributes. Also, you can specify default values for any attributes of the type; users can overwrite these values for a particular piece of equipment.{br}

You can deactivate an obsolete attribute for equipment of a particular type by clearing the '''Active''' check box on this tab. If you do, the deactivated attribute will no longer be displayed for the equipment of the type, but all attribute values that have already been specified for existing equipment will still be stored in the database. If you re-activate the attribute, its values (where specified) will become visible in the system again. {br}

However, if it is not necessary to preserve the data related to an obsolete attribute, you can deactivate the attribute and then delete it by using the '''Delete Row''' button on the table toolbar. In this case, the attribute will be permanently deleted from the type and all attribute values will be deleted from the database.
==Assigning Equipment Types to Services==
You can specify which types of resource equipment are needed for each service. Services are defined in the system as non-stock items of the ''Service'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. You assign the appropriate equipment types to the service on the '''Resource Equipment Types''' tab of this form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_Needed_Equipment|To Assign Equipment Types to a Service].

In Acumatica ERP, you can enter and keep information about ''resource equipment''. Resource equipment is a physical resource of your company that staff members use to perform services. You specify the appropriate equipment type for each resource equipment to ensure that the right equipment will later be selected to perform these services.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how resource equipment is added to the system, and how this equipment is assigned to appointments.{br}{TOC}
==Adding Resource Equipment==
You add each specific entity of resource equipment (for example, a specific screwdriver or drill) that will be used to perform services on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form. In the Summary area of the form, you define this item as a resource equipment by selecting the '''Resource Equipment''' check box, select the equipment type, and specify that your company owns the equipment by selecting the '''Company''' option button (under '''Owner'''). For details on how to add resource equipment, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_a_Resource_Equipment|To Add Resource Equipment].{br}

To maintain the relevant details of each equipment entity you add to the system, you can record additional information, such as general, manufacturing, and purchase information. For details on manufacturing information, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Manufacturers|Manufacturers].{br}

Also Acumatica ERP includes the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_80_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=EP208000|EP208000]) form, which is generally used to specify equipment that can be used for projects. For any equipment that has been added to your system by using this form, you can make it available for use with the field services functionality by clicking '''Extend to SM Equipment''' on the form toolbar and then specifying the necessary information on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] form in the Equipment Management functional area, which the system brings up.{br}

You can view information about equipment in the system on multiple forms. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Equipment_Viewing|Equipment Inquiries].[anchor|#_7d9b5069-1538-419e-9984-45df8ccbefd5]
==Specifying Attributes==
To give users the ability to specify additional information for a piece of equipment, so that your company can track this information, attributes have to be defined for the related equipment type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_08_00|Equipment Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Equipment_Types#_5903681c-4c3c-417e-af0b-d127f27487b7|Setting Up Attributes for Equipment Type].{br}

When you create a piece of equipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form and select its equipment type, the system populates the '''Attributes''' tab with the attributes (and any default values) defined for the equipment type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_08_00|Equipment Types] form. You can specify or modify equipment attribute values in the '''Values''' column. If the '''Required''' check box is selected for an attribute, the value has to be specified before you save the new equipment you are creating.{br}

Also on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form are the '''Image''' set of elements, which you can use to attach an image of the piece of equipment.
==Assigning Resource Equipment to Appointments==
You can assign the necessary resource equipment to the appointments of a service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form or to a particular appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form. You use the '''Resource Equipment''' tab of either form to assign the resource equipment. On this tab, for each equipment entity you want to add, you add a row and select the necessary equipment entity from the list in the '''Equipment ID '''column.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Resource Equipment In  Acumatica ERP , you can enter and keep information about  resource                         equipment . Resource equipment is a physical resource of your company                     that staff members use to perform services. You specify the appropriate                     equipment type for each resource equipment to ensure that the right equipment                     will later be selected to perform these services. In this topic, you will read about how resource equipment is added to the system,                     and how this equipment is assigned to appointments. Adding Resource Equipment You add each specific entity of resource equipment (for example, a specific                     screwdriver or drill) that will be used to perform services on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS205000) form. In the Summary area                     of the form, you define this item as a resource equipment by selecting the                          Resource Equipment  check box, select the equipment                     type, and specify that your company owns the equipment by selecting the                          Company  option button (under                          Owner ). For details on how to add resource equipment,                     see  To Add Resource Equipment. To maintain the relevant details of each equipment entity you add to the system,                     you can record additional information, such as general, manufacturing, and                     purchase information. For details on manufacturing information, see  Manufacturers. Also  Acumatica ERP  includes the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP208000|EP208000]) Equipment (EP208000) form, which is generally                     used to specify equipment that can be used for projects. For any equipment that                     has been added to your system by using this form, you can make it available for                     use with the field services functionality by clicking  Extend to SM                         Equipment  on the form toolbar and then specifying the necessary                     information on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment form in the                     Equipment Management functional area, which the system brings up. You can view information about equipment in the system on multiple forms. For                     details, see  Equipment Inquiries. Specifying Attributes To give users the ability to specify additional information for a piece of equipment, so that                 your company can track this information, attributes have to be defined for the                 related equipment type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) Equipment Types                 (FS200800) form. For details, see  Setting Up Attributes for Equipment Type. When you create a piece of equipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment                 (FS300100) form and select its equipment type, the system populates the                      Attributes  tab with the attributes (and any default                 values) defined for the equipment type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) Equipment Types form. You can specify or modify equipment                 attribute values in the  Values  column. If the                      Required  check box is selected for an attribute, the                 value has to be specified before you save the new equipment you are creating. Also on the  Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS300100) form are  the                      Image  set of elements, which you can use to attach an                 image of the piece of equipment. Assigning Resource Equipment to Appointments You can assign the necessary resource equipment to the appointments of a service                     order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form or to                     a particular appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments                     (FS300200) form. You use the  Resource Equipment  tab of                     either form to assign the resource equipment. On this tab, for each equipment                     entity you want to add, you add a row and select the necessary equipment entity                     from the list in the  Equipment ID  column.                       ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300])  ([~/?ScreenId=EP208000|EP208000])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS400200|FS400200])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, if you use the equipment management functionality to keep track of stock items and their parts after they are sold, you need to create appropriate item classes. Item classes, which are created and maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, are used to group stock or non-stock items with similar properties and to provide default settings for new items. {br}

In this topic, you will read about the equipment and component item classes that you can create in the system.
==Part or Other Inventory Item Class==
You create an item class of the '''Part or Other Inventory''' type in one of the following situations:[anchor|#_cb57223f-30d6-4e6a-8f06-f1d0d4060b0c]
*You need to create an item class of this type for stock items that are not related to equipment entities and should not be tracked in the Equipment Management functional area.
*Your company has stock items that can be sold as parts of equipment entities and can be covered as a part of the equipment entity warranty. For example, suppose that a vehicle purchased by a customer is defined in the system as target equipment under warranty. You want to register that a sale of a spark plug for this vehicle is covered by the vehicle warranty. You have to create at least one item class of the '''Part or Other Inventory''' equipment type and assign an item class of this type to the spark plug stock item.
{br}

To create this type of item class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you select the '''Part or Other Inventory''' option button under '''Equipment Item Class''' in the '''Equipment Management''' section on the '''Service Management''' tab.[anchor|#_f9c92619-5185-4b02-a3ad-f8ea87347a5d]
==Model Equipment Item Class==
You create at least one model equipment item class if after stock items are sold, you want to track them (and their components if necessary) for preventive maintenance or warranty handling. When you create this item class, to specify that it is a model equipment item class, you select the '''Model Equipment''' option button under '''Equipment Item Class''' in the '''Equipment Management''' section on the '''Service Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.{br}

If you need to track the components of model equipment and perform actions (such as selling and replacing) upon these components, you should first create at least one component item class (for details, see the next section of this topic). In the table on the '''Service Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] form for the model equipment item class, you then specify these components and assign them component item classes. You also specify the default quantity of each component and whether it is optional. Then when a stock item is created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form and the model equipment class is selected, the system fills in the components in the table on the '''Service Management''' tab. ((({S:Hint}You can create model equipment with components only if components have been specified for its item class.
)))
For instructions on how to create a model equipment item class, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Item_Class_With_Components|To Create an Item Class for Model Equipment].[anchor|#_7d72e1f4-e4ce-4b38-94a9-66d6b656e081]
==Component Item Class==
You create at least one component item class if a stock item, defined as a model equipment in the system, has components that you want to keep track of for preventive maintenance or warranty handling. Each component that you need to track and perform actions upon (that is, selling and replacing them) has to be defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form as a stock item assigned to a component item class. You define each component item class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. To specify that the item class is a component item class, you select the '''Component''' option button under '''Equipment Item Class''' in the '''Equipment Management''' section on the '''Service Management''' tab.((({S:Hint}You need to associate a component with a stock item only if you will need to reflect in the system selling and replacing components.
)))
For instructions on how to create a component item class, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Item_Class_Components|To Create an Item Class for Components].
==Consumable Item Class==
You create at least one consumable item class for items that are sold as parts of equipment entities but are not under a warranty. To specify that the item class is a consumable item class, you select the '''Consumable''' option button under '''Equipment Item Class''' in the '''Equipment Management''' section on the '''Service Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.{br}

For example, a vehicle is a customer&rsquo;s target equipment under warranty. You want to register in the system an oil change for the vehicle. To do this, you have to assign an item class of the '''Consumable''' equipment type to the stock item representing the oil.{br}

For instructions on how to create a consumable item class, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Item_Class_Consumables|To Create an Item Class for Consumable Items].

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, you can enter and maintain information about ''target equipment''. Target equipment is equipment that needs to be serviced at the customer site or at your company. You can enter this equipment into the system manually, or it can be created automatically when a stock item that is model equipment (that is, a stock item intended to be tracked by your company after its sale) is sold by your company.{br}

A piece of target equipment may have components. A component is a part of an equipment entity that can have a warranty and a serial number that are independent of the related equipment entity.{br}

If your company sells equipment that it expects to service later, you should define at least one item class to be assigned to stock items that will become equipment. You should also define any components of the stock item in the item class. {br}

In this topic, you will read about how to add target equipment to the system, how to create target equipment for sold stock items, how to define components and warranties, and how to assign target equipment to services.
==Adding Target Equipment==
You add each specific entity of target equipment to the system to track all the equipment for which your company provides services. You can add it manually in one of the following ways:[anchor|#_f2124963-5b32-4040-b746-0446066f972d]
*If the equipment is not already defined in your system, you enter this new equipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_Equipment|To Add Equipment].
*If the equipment was already defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_80_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=EP208000|EP208000]) form (Organization) and used for projects, you can click '''Extend to SM Equipment''' on the form toolbar to add this equipment to the Equipment Management functional area. The system brings up the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] form in the Equipment Management functional area with the relevant information filled in, and you can add or change any information and save your changes.
{br}

If your company routinely sells a stock item that your company personnel then service, you can configure the system to automatically create the target equipment entity when an invoice is released for a sales order that includes the stock item. 
==Creating Target Equipment for Sold Items==
For target equipment that your company sells as stock items and that you want to track in the system after its sale, you have to define the stock items as model equipment. If a stock item defined as model equipment is added to a sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and the ''Selling Target Equipment'' action is selected in the '''Equipment Action''' column for this model equipment, when an invoice related to the sales order is released, the system converts the entity of model equipment to an entity of target equipment. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Model_Equipment|Model Equipment]. {br}

To convert to target equipment a stock item that was not defined as model equipment and was sold, you do the following:[anchor|#_9a856a11-d7a3-47e9-a7af-87b26e1d9f02]
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, select the stock item and assign a model equipment item class to it in the '''Item Classes''' box. For details on model equipment item classes, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Equipment_Item_Class#_f9c92619-5185-4b02-a3ad-f8ea87347a5d|Model Equipment Item Class].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_09_00|Create Equipment for Sold Items] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500900|FS500900]) form, create target equipment entity to be tracked in the Equipment Management functional area for the stock item. For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Equipment_for_Sold_Items|To Create Equipment for Sold Items].

Regardless of when the stock item was converted to target equipment, it may have components; that is, you may have specified components for the item class on the '''Service Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] form. In this case, after you convert the stock items to target equipment, for each piece of equipment created, you should specify the details of its components on the '''Component and Warranties''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form.
==Defining Components and Their Warranties==
You can keep details on the components of each piece of target equipment and their warranties. To add components to a piece of target equipment, in the '''Model''' box on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form, select the identifier of the model equipment (that is, the inventory ID of the stock item that is defined as model equipment) related to this piece of target equipment. The system adds to the piece of equipment the components that have been assigned to the model equipment on the '''Service Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.{br}

You can view the components that are defined in the system and their warranty information on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_40_07_00|Component Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=FS400700|FS400700]) form.[anchor|#_379295b5-7f5c-4134-9bf6-3fc9bd85cc30]
==Specifying Attributes==
To give users the ability to specify additional information for a piece of equipment, so that your company can track this information, attributes have to be defined for the related equipment type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_08_00|Equipment Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Equipment_Types#_5903681c-4c3c-417e-af0b-d127f27487b7|Setting Up Attributes for Equipment Type].{br}

When you create a piece of equipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form and select its equipment type, the system populates the '''Attributes''' tab with the attributes (and any default values) defined for the equipment type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_08_00|Equipment Types] form. You can specify or modify equipment attribute values in the '''Values''' column. If the '''Required''' check box is selected for an attribute, the value has to be specified before you save the new equipment you are creating.{br}

Also on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form are the '''Image''' set of elements, which you can use to attach an image of the piece of equipment.
==Assigning Target Equipment and Components to Services==
You can assign the necessary target equipment to the services of a service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form or to the services of an appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form. On the '''Services''' tab of either form, in the in the '''Target Equipment ID '''column of the row for each service that is performed on equipment, you select the identifier of the target equipment entity from the list. {br}

You can also assign target equipment to a schedule of a service contract in the '''Equipment ID''' column on the '''Services''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) form. After you have done this, when you generate service orders or appointments for the contract, the service orders will already contain the target equipment assigned to the schedule of the applicable contract. Similarly, you can assign components to schedules.{br}

Also, while viewing a piece of target equipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form, you can schedule an appointment for servicing the equipment by using the '''Schedule Appointments''' menu. For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Scheduling|Appointment Scheduling Options]. 
==Performing Actions on Target Equipment==
After you have created target equipment in the system, while you are working with a sales order, service order, or appointment, you can easily register the following actions if they are performed upon particular target equipment entities:[anchor|#_88dd6231-72cc-478b-b86b-8c12b5f82b05]
*Selling an optional component of target equipment (for details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Selling_Optional_Component_Target|Selling an Optional Component of Target Equipment])
*Replacing target equipment (as described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Replacing_Target_Equipment|Replacing Target Equipment])
*Replacing components of target equipment (for details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Replacing_Component|Replacing a Component of Target Equipment])

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Target Equipment In  Acumatica ERP, you can enter and maintain information about  target equipment . Target equipment         is equipment that needs to be serviced at the customer site or at your company. You can         enter this equipment into the system manually, or it can be created automatically when a         stock item that is model equipment (that is, a stock item intended to be tracked by your         company after its sale) is sold by your company. A piece of target equipment may have components. A component is a part of an equipment         entity that can have a warranty and a serial number that are independent of the related         equipment entity. If your company sells equipment that it expects to service later, you should define at         least one item class to be assigned to stock items that will become equipment. You should         also define any components of the stock item in the item class.          In this topic, you will read about how to add target equipment to the system, how to create         target equipment for sold stock items, how to define components and warranties, and how to         assign target equipment to services. Adding Target Equipment You add each specific entity of target equipment to the system to track all the equipment         for which your company provides services. You can add it manually in one of the following           ways: If the equipment is not already defined in your system, you enter this new equipment             on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS205000) form. For details, see  To Add Equipment. If the equipment was already defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP208000|EP208000]) Equipment (EP208000)             form (Organization) and used for projects, you can click  Extend to SM               Equipment  on the form toolbar to add this equipment to the Equipment             Management functional area. The system brings up the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment             form in the Equipment Management functional area with the relevant information filled             in, and you can add or change any information and save your changes. If your company routinely sells a stock item that your company personnel then service, you         can configure the system to automatically create the target equipment entity when an invoice         is released for a sales order that includes the stock item.  Creating Target Equipment for Sold Items For target equipment that your company sells as stock items and that you want to track in         the system after its sale, you have to define the stock items as model equipment. If a stock         item defined as model equipment is added to a sales order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and the  Selling Target Equipment          action is selected in the  Equipment Action  column for this model         equipment, when an invoice related to the sales order is released, the system converts the         entity of model equipment to an entity of target equipment. For details, see  Model Equipment.  To convert to target equipment a stock item that was not defined as model equipment and was         sold, you do the following: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, select the stock item and           assign a model equipment item class to it in the  Item Classes  box.           For details on model equipment item classes, see  Model Equipment Item Class. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500900|FS500900]) Create Equipment for Sold Items (FS500900) form, create target equipment entity           to be tracked in the Equipment Management functional area for the stock item. For           instructions, see  To Create Equipment for Sold Items. Regardless of when the stock item was converted to target equipment, it may have         components; that is, you may have specified components for the item class on the            Service Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes form.         In this case, after you convert the stock items to target equipment, for each piece of         equipment created, you should specify the details of its components on the            Component and Warranties  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment         (FS205000) form. Defining Components and Their Warranties You can keep details on the components of each piece of target equipment and their         warranties. To add components to a piece of target equipment, in the            Model  box on the  General Info  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS205000) form, select the identifier of the model         equipment (that is, the inventory ID of the stock item that is defined as model equipment)         related to this piece of target equipment. The system adds to the piece of equipment the         components that have been assigned to the model equipment on the  Service           Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. You can view the components that are defined in the system and their warranty information         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS400700|FS400700]) Component Summary (FS400700) form. Specifying Attributes To give users the ability to specify additional information for a piece of equipment, so that                 your company can track this information, attributes have to be defined for the                 related equipment type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) Equipment Types                 (FS200800) form. For details, see  Setting Up Attributes for Equipment Type. When you create a piece of equipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment                 (FS300100) form and select its equipment type, the system populates the                      Attributes  tab with the attributes (and any default                 values) defined for the equipment type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS200800|FS200800]) Equipment Types form. You can specify or modify equipment                 attribute values in the  Values  column. If the                      Required  check box is selected for an attribute, the                 value has to be specified before you save the new equipment you are creating. Also on the  Attributes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS300100) form are  the                      Image  set of elements, which you can use to attach an                 image of the piece of equipment. Assigning Target Equipment and Components to Services You can assign the necessary target equipment to the services of a service order on the             ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form or to the services of an appointment on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form. On the            Services  tab of either form, in the in the  Target           Equipment ID  column of the row for each service that is performed on         equipment, you select the identifier of the target equipment entity from the list.  You can also assign target equipment to a schedule of a service contract in the            Equipment ID  column on the  Services  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) Service Contract Schedules (FS305100) form. After you have done this, when you         generate service orders or appointments for the contract, the service orders will already         contain the target equipment assigned to the schedule of the applicable contract. Similarly,         you can assign components to schedules. Also, while viewing a piece of target equipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment         (FS205000) form, you can schedule an appointment for servicing the equipment by using the            Schedule Appointments  menu. For details on scheduling appointments,         see  Appointment Scheduling Options.          Performing Actions on Target Equipment After you have created target equipment in the system, while you are working with a sales         order, service order, or appointment, you can easily register the following actions if they         are performed upon particular target equipment entities: Selling an optional component of target equipment (for details, see  Selling an Optional Component of Target Equipment) Replacing target equipment (as described in  Replacing Target Equipment) Replacing components of target equipment (for details, see  Replacing a Component of Target Equipment)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS204800|FS204800])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS204400|FS204400])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS400400|FS400400])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, you can keep track of a stock item after it has been sold to a customer. To do that, you create a ''model equipment'' entity that is based on the stock item. A piece of model equipment is a stock item that can be sold to a customer and tracked by your company after it is sold. When an invoice is released, the system automatically converts it into target equipment that you can track. You can also keep track of the details of the components of model equipment, such as the serial numbers of these components.{br}

In this topic, you will read about adding a model equipment entity, defining the components of the model equipment, selling the model equipment, and performing additional actions on the equipment.{br}{TOC}
==Understanding the Process of Model Equipment Creation==
To create a model equipment entity in the system, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_5c286b45-bd17-4d8b-9db3-ee571a72019d]
#If you want to track the components of the model equipment entity in the system, you create at least one item class for components on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. For details on component item classes, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Equipment_Item_Class#_7d72e1f4-e4ce-4b38-94a9-66d6b656e081|Component Item Class].
#You create an item class for model equipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] form. If the model equipment has components, you have to specify them in the item class and assign them a component item class. For details on model equipment item classes, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Equipment_Item_Class#_f9c92619-5185-4b02-a3ad-f8ea87347a5d|Model Equipment Item Class].
#If your company is going to register the selling and replacing of components in the system while employees work with either service orders or sales orders, you create stock items for the components of this model equipment entity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. For details on selling and replacing components, see the component-related topics in the [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_EM_Use_Cases|Equipment Management Use Cases] chapter.
#You create the model equipment entity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form.

==Creating Model Equipment==
You create a model equipment entity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. For each entity of model equipment, you specify its identifier and description, and select a model equipment item class. ((({S:Hint}You can also convert an already-defined stock item to model equipment. To do this, navigate to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, select the needed stock item, and then select a model equipment item class for it.
)))
When you select the class for the stock item, the system fills in the default settings (along with any components) that have been specified for the class and selects the '''Model Equipment''' check box on the '''Service Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, which defines the stock item as model equipment. You then specify the manufacturer of the equipment in the '''Manufacturer''' box (for details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Manufacturers|Manufacturers]) and save your changes to the stock item that is defined as model equipment.{br}

For instructions on how to add model equipment, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_Model_Equipment_With_Components|To Add Model Equipment].[anchor|#_c6a2bf10-b3a5-4a5c-ab35-9c18c203504f]
==Defining an Equipment Type for Model Equipment==
While you are creating a stock item that is defined as model equipment, you can specify a type related to the equipment in the '''Equipment Type''' box on the '''Service Management '''tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. 
When the system converts the model equipment to target equipment from the sale of the stock item, if the attributes specified for the selected equipment type are the same as those that are defined for the stock item, these attributes are copied to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form. If the attributes defined for the stock item are not the same as the attributes specified for the selected equipment type, when the system creates the target equipment from the sale of the stock item, the attributes of only the type are copied to the form.
For example, suppose that the ''LAPTOP'' equipment type has the attributes ''COLOR'' and ''OFFICELOCATION''. Also, the ''LAPTOP1'' stock item is defined as model equipment with the ''LAPTOP'' equipment type, and this stock item has the following attributes:[anchor|#_dd732a01-5c97-4299-8e4c-6810681cc334]
*''INDUSTRY'', with the ''IT'' value
*''COLOR'', which has the ''BLACK'' value
*''VENDORCONTRACT'', with the ''CIN001'' value

When a ''LAPTOP1'' item is sold through a sales order, the system identifies that both the stock item and the equipment type have the ''COLOR'' attribute and creates a piece of equipment with the ''COLOR'' attribute with the ''BLACK'' value and the ''OFFICELOCATION'' attribute without a value. (The user can fill in the ''OFFICELOCATION'' value and change the ''COLOR'' value, if needed, for the piece of equipment.) The ''INDUSTRY'' and ''VENDORCONTRACT'' attributes are not used because they have not been specified for the ''LAPTOP'' equipment type. 
==Defining Components and Warranties==
If components are defined for a model equipment item class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, the system adds the components with the default settings when you create a model equipment entity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form and select this item class. In the Components table of the '''Service Management''' tab, you can view the details of the components and change them if necessary.((({S:Hint}You can add only components that are defined for the model equipment item class.
)))
If you are going to perform sales or replacement of these components and track them in the system, stock items should be created in the system for them. If stock items have been created for any of the components listed for a model equipment entity, you select the default inventory identifier of each such component in the '''Inventory ID''' column in the Components table. {br}

On this tab, you can also specify the warranty period provided for the model equipment in the '''Equipment General Warranty''' section, and for its components in the table. Based on the information provided in this section, the system calculates the warranty period for target equipment that is created for this model equipment. Depending on the setting in the '''Equipment Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_03_00|Equipment Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100300|FS100300]) form, the system uses an installation date or the sales date to calculate the warranty period.
==Selling Model Equipment==
When you sell model equipment, you create a sales order that includes the equipment being sold for (with the ''Selling Model Equipment'' action selected) on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. You then process the sales order, as described in [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Inventory_Sales|Processing Sales of Stock Items]. {br}

When you release the invoice for the sales order, the system creates a target equipment entity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00_2|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form with the customer location assigned based on the customer location that was assigned to the model equipment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. For details on target equipment, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Target_Equipment|Target Equipment].{br}

Alternatively, you can reflect a sell of a piece of model equipment in an appointment or service order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] (FS30.02.00) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form, respectively. If you use these forms, you can schedule the installation of the equipment along with the sale.
==Performing Actions on Model Equipment==
After you have created target equipment in the system, while you are working with a sales order, service order, or appointment, you can easily register the following actions being performed upon particular target equipment entities:[anchor|#_88dd6231-72cc-478b-b86b-8c12b5f82b05]
*Selling a piece for model equipment (for details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Selling_Model_Equipment|Selling Model Equipment])
*Selling model equipment and optional component for it (for details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Selling_Optional_Component|Selling a Model Equipment Entity and Optional Component])
*Selling a model equipment with a replaced default component (as described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Upgrading_Component|Upgrading a Default Component of Model Equipment to Be Sold])

For             details on component item classes, see  Component Item Class. You create an item class for model equipment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes form. If the model             equipment has components, you have to specify them in the item class and assign them a             component item class. For details on model equipment item classes, see  Model Equipment Item Class. If your company is going to register the selling and replacing of components in the             system while employees work with either service orders or sales orders, you create stock             items for the components of this model equipment entity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. For details on selling and replacing             components, see the component-related topics in the  Equipment Management Use Cases chapter. You create the model equipment entity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items             form. Creating Model Equipment You create a model equipment entity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form.         For each entity of model equipment, you specify its identifier and description, and select a         model equipment item class.  You can also convert an already-defined stock item to model equipment. To do this,         navigate to the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, select the needed stock item, and then         select a model equipment item class for it. When you select the class for the stock item, the system fills in the default settings         (along with any components) that have been specified for the class and selects the            Model Equipment  check box on the  Service           Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, which defines the         stock item as model equipment. You then specify the manufacturer of the equipment in the            Manufacturer  box (for details, see  Manufacturers) and save your changes to the stock item that is         defined as model equipment. For instructions on how to add model equipment, see  To Add Model Equipment. Defining an Equipment Type for Model Equipment While you are creating a stock item that is defined as model equipment, you can specify a         type related to the equipment in the  Equipment Type  box on the            Service Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items         (IN202500) form.  When the system converts the model equipment to target equipment from the sale of the stock         item, if the          attributes          specified for the selected equipment type are the same as those that are defined          for         the stock item ,          the se         attributes are copied to the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS205000) form.         If          the         attributes  defined for the stock item are not the same as the attributes         specified for the selected equipment type, when the system creates the target equipment from         the sale of          the          stock item, the attributes of only the type are copied to the form. For example, suppose that the  LAPTOP  equipment type has the attributes  COLOR          and  OFFICELOCATION . Also, the  LAPTOP1  stock item is defined as model equipment         with the  LAPTOP  equipment type, and this stock item has the following attributes: INDUSTRY , with the  IT  value COLOR , which has the  BLACK  value VENDORCONTRACT , with the  CIN001  value When a  LAPTOP1  item is sold through a sales order, the system identifies that both         the stock item and the equipment type have the  COLOR  attribute and creates a piece of         equipment with the  COLOR  attribute with the  BLACK  value and the            OFFICELOCATION  attribute without a value. (The user can fill in the            OFFICELOCATION  value and change the  COLOR  value, if needed, for the piece of         equipment.) The  INDUSTRY  and  VENDORCONTRACT  attributes are not used because         they have not been specified for the  LAPTOP  equipment type.          Defining Components and Warranties If components are defined for a model equipment item class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, the         system adds the components with the default settings when you create a model equipment         entity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form and select this item class. In         the Components table of the  Service Management  tab, you can view the         details of the components and change them if necessary. You can add only components that are defined for the model equipment item class. If you are going to perform sales or replacement of these components and track them in the         system, stock items should be created in the system for them. If stock items have been         created for any of the components listed for a model equipment entity, you select the         default inventory identifier of each such component in the  Inventory           ID  column in the Components table.  On this tab, you can also specify the warranty period provided for the model equipment in         the  Equipment General Warranty  section, and for its components in the         table. Based on the information provided in this section, the system calculates the warranty         period for target equipment that is created for this model equipment. Depending on the         setting in the  Equipment Settings  section of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100300|FS100300]) Equipment Management Preferences (FS100300) form, the         system uses an installation date or the sales date to calculate the warranty period. Selling Model Equipment When you sell model equipment, you create a sales order that includes the equipment being         sold for (with the  Selling Model Equipment  action selected) on the            Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders         (SO301000) form. You then process the sales order, as described in  Processing Sales of Stock Items.  When you release the invoice for the sales order, the system creates a target equipment         entity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS205000) form with the customer location         assigned based on the customer location that was assigned to the model equipment on the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. For details on target equipment, see            Target Equipment. Alternatively, you can reflect a sell of a piece of model equipment in an appointment or         service order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS30.02.00) or   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form, respectively. If you use these forms, you can         schedule the installation of the equipment along with the sale. Performing Actions on Model Equipment After you have created target equipment in the system, while you are working with a sales         order, service order, or appointment, you can easily register the following actions being         performed upon particular target equipment entities: Selling a piece for model equipment (for details, see  Selling Model Equipment) Selling model equipment and optional component for it (for details, see  Selling a Model Equipment Entity and Optional Component) Selling a model equipment with a replaced default component (as described in  Upgrading a Default Component of Model Equipment to Be Sold)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) ]]></column>

 Acumatica ERP provides you with the functionality of processing and tracking contracts on services that customers of your company order. A service contract represents a document that contains information on periodical services that a customer has ordered. For instance, you can use service contracts to create maintenance schedules for target equipment.{br}

In Acumatica ERP you can select whether the billing for a service contract is performed after each appointment was attended based on what was done during the appointment (that is, ''as-performed billing'') or the billing is performed based on what is covered by the contract at the end of the billing period (that is, ''standardized billing''). {br}

This chapter describes the following concepts: the general workflow of the two types of service contracts; the creation, activation, cancellation, and suspension of the contracts in the system; service contract schedules; the generation of service orders or appointments from contracts; and the generation of invoices for service contracts with standardized billing in Acumatica ERP.

In Acumatica ERP, you can control the steps required to process your company&rsquo;s service contracts with as-performed billing—that is, service contracts that are billed after each appointment took place based on what was done during the appointment. For these contracts, the ''As Performed Billings'' option is selected in the '''Billing Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the general workflow of the processing of service contracts with as-performed billing and about the tracking of the history of actions performed for the contract.{br}{TOC}
==Processing Workflow==
In general, the processing of a service contract with as-performed billing consists of the following steps:[anchor|#_2fbe3bc9-d9b8-4def-a6f6-e7932fe15550]
#Entering the service contract: The scheduler or service manager enters the service contract with as-performed billing into the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Creation|Entry of the Service Contract].
#Creating at least one schedule: The scheduler creates the schedule (or schedules) for the service delivery related to the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_SC_Schedules|Service Contract Schedules].
#Activating the service contract: The scheduler activates the service contract with as-performed billing in the system so that he or she can generate service orders or appointments for the contract schedules. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Activation|Activation of a Service Contract].
#Generating the service orders or appointments: The scheduler generates the service orders or appointments. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Generating_SO|Generation of a Service Order or an Appointment ].
#:After the service orders or appointments have been generated, they are processed, as described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Order_Processing|Service Order Processing Workflow] or [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Appointment_Processing|Appointment Processing Workflow].
#Generating and processing billing documents: An accountant approves the service orders or appointments of the service contract for the generation of invoices. He or she then generates invoices for the service orders or appointments, and processes them in the system. For details on how to bill the customer for provided services, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Invoices|Generation of Billing Documents from Service Orders] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Invoices_from_Appointments|Generation of Billing Documents from Appointments].
#Suspending the contract (optional): If it is necessary to hold the contract for a while, the scheduler can suspend the contract. The contract can then be activated again. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Suspension|Suspension of a Service Contract].
#Canceling the contact (optional): If the scheduler has activated the contract but the services for the contract are not going to be provided for some reason, the scheduler can cancel the contract. This step can be performed before or after your company has started to provide services according to the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Cancellation|Cancellation of a Service Contract].

The following diagram illustrates the processing of a service contract with as-performed billing.[anchor|#_46f7f92e-f2fe-47bf-a5d2-5d8fefc72066][anchor|#_0406e406-8d95-43ff-aefd-79be247594f3][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__As_Performed_Service_Contract.png|popup|Processing of a service contract with as-performed billing|450px][anchor|#_be33c839-5d5c-4aea-b0a3-e55adbef0681]
==Service Contract History==
For each contract, you can view the history of actions that have been performed on the contract or its schedules on the '''Contract History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form.{br}

For the service contract, you can view the date when the action was invoked and the date when the action is applied. You can view the history of the following contract actions: ''Create'', ''Activate'', ''Suspend'', ''Cancel'', and ''Expire''.{br}

For the schedules of the service contract, you can view the date when the action was invoked, the recurrence description and any modification of the recurrence (if the contract has been suspended and activated again). You can view the history of the following schedule actions: ''Create'', ''Inactivate'', and ''Delete''.

For these contracts, the  As           Performed Billings  option is selected in the  Billing Type  box         on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) Service Contracts (FS305700)         form. In this topic, you will read about the general workflow of the processing of service         contracts with as-performed billing and about the tracking of the history of actions         performed for the contract. Processing Workflow In general, the processing of a service contract with as-performed billing consists of the         following steps: Entering the service contract: The scheduler or service manager enters the service           contract with as-performed billing into the system. For details, see  Entry of the Service Contract. Creating at least one schedule: The scheduler creates the schedule (or schedules) for           the service delivery related to the contract. For details, see  Service Contract Schedules. Activating the service contract: The scheduler activates the service contract with           as-performed billing in the system so that he or she can generate service orders or           appointments for the contract schedules. For details, see  Activation of a Service Contract. Generating the service orders or appointments: The scheduler generates the service           orders or appointments. For details, see  Generation of a Service Order or an Appointment . After the service orders or appointments have been generated, they are processed,             as described in  Service Order Processing Workflow or  Appointment Processing Workflow. Generating and processing billing documents: An accountant approves the service orders           or appointments of the service contract for the generation of invoices. He or she then           generates invoices for the service orders or appointments, and processes them in the           system. For details on how to bill the customer for provided services, see  Generation of Billing Documents from Service Orders and  Generation of Billing Documents from Appointments. Suspending the contract (optional): If it is necessary to hold the contract for a while,           the scheduler can suspend the contract. The contract can then be activated again. For           details, see  Suspension of a Service Contract. Canceling the contact (optional): If the scheduler has activated the contract but the           services for the contract are not going to be provided for some reason, the scheduler can           cancel the contract. This step can be performed before or after your company has started           to provide services according to the contract. For details, see  Cancellation of a Service Contract. The following diagram illustrates the processing of a service contract with as-performed         billing.

In Acumatica ERP, you can control the steps required to process your company&rsquo;s service contracts with standardized billing—that is, service contracts that are billed at the end of each billing period for the items that have been specified in the contract as well as for overage items. For these contracts, the ''Standardized Plus Usage/Overage Billings'' option is selected in the '''Billing Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the general workflow of the processing of service contracts with standardized billing and about the tracking of the history of actions performed for the contract.{br}{TOC}
==Processing Workflow==
In general, the processing of a service contract with standardized billing consists of the following steps:[anchor|#_eafe3d11-c24d-4621-91b8-8711e4c684da]
#Entering the service contract: The scheduler or service manager enters the service contract with standardized billing into the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Creation|Entry of the Service Contract].
#Creating at least one schedule (optional): The scheduler creates the schedule (or schedules) for the service delivery for the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_SC_Schedules|Service Contract Schedules].
#Activating the service contract: The scheduler activates the service contract with standardized billing in the system, so that he or she can generate service orders or appointments for the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Activation|Activation of a Service Contract].
#Generating the service orders or appointments: If a related schedule has been created, the scheduler generates service orders or appointments. After the service orders or appointments have been generated, they are processed. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Generating_SO|Generation of a Service Order or an Appointment ].
#Creating the service orders or appointments on the fly: If a related schedule has not been created or additional appointments are needed, the scheduler creates service orders or appointments. The service orders or appointments are then processed. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_SO|To Create a Service Order] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Quick_Appointment|To Create an Appointment Without a Service Order].
#Generating and processing billing documents: An accountant approves the service orders or appointments of the service contract for the generation of billing documents. He or she then generates billing documents for a particular billing period, and processes the documents in the system. For details on how to bill the customer for provided services, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Invoice_Generation_for_Contracts|Billing Customers for Service Contracts Based on Standardized Billing ].
#Modify the next billing period (optional): If any changes are necessary, the scheduler modifies the next billing period. The scheduler can add or delete services and non-stock items for the next billing period. He or she can also modify the quantity and prices of the existing items.
#Activate the next billing period (optional): If the '''Activate Upcoming Period on Invoice Generation''' check box is not selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_03_00|Equipment Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100300|FS100300]) form, the scheduler activates the next billing period for the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Activate_Next_Period|To Activate the Next Period for Contracts with Standardized Billing].
#Suspending the contract (optional): If it is necessary to hold the contract for a while, the scheduler can suspend the contract. The contract can then be activated again. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Suspension|Suspension of a Service Contract].
#Canceling the contact (optional): If the scheduler has activated the contract but the services for the contract are not going to be provided for some reason, the scheduler can cancel the contract. This step can be performed before or after your company has started to provide services according to the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Cancellation|Cancellation of a Service Contract].

The following diagram illustrates the processing of a service contract with standardized billing.[anchor|#_0abb49cb-2773-493d-a65f-7fe811d86636][anchor|#_0163a861-8236-4ec4-8188-7146d2de4b71][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Standardized_Billing_Service_Contract.png|popup|Processing of a service contract with standardized billing|450px][anchor|#_53b2769a-a3f9-4765-94a7-5cbd56296729]
==Service Contract History==
For each contract, you can view the history of actions that have been performed on the contract or its schedules on the '''Contract History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form.{br}

For the service contract, you can view the date when the action was invoked and the date when the action is applied. You can view the history of the following contract actions: ''Create'', ''Activate'', ''Suspend'', ''Cancel'', and ''Expire''.{br}

For the schedules of the service contract, you can view the date when the action was invoked, the recurrence description and any modification of the recurrence (if the contract has been suspended and activated again). You can view the history of the following schedule actions: ''Create'', ''Inactivate'', and ''Delete''.

When you enter a contract, you specify its general information (such as date and customer information), specify the billing type, and assign schedules to the contract. Depending on the billing type, you provide different information on the service contract. When you save the service contract, it is initially assigned the ''Draft'' status; you can then modify the contract details or activate the contract.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the information to be specified when you create service contracts with as-performed billing and with standardized billing.{br}{TOC}
==General Information to Be Specified in a Service Contract==
When you enter the service contract on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form, you specify the following information: [anchor|#_81ee9eec-3696-4aeb-97f5-e9552291550b]
*The customer and its location (if required): You specify these settings in the '''Customer''' and '''Location''' boxes in the Summary area of the form.
*The date information of the service contract: You specify the start date and end date (if the contract has an expiration date) of the contract in the '''Contract Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab.
*Your company&rsquo;s branch and its location: You specify these settings in the '''Branch''' and '''Branch Location''' boxes of the '''Billing Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab.
*The type of billing to be used for the service contract: You select whether the billing for a service contract is performed after each appointments has been attended based on what was done during the appointment (as-performed billing) or the billing is performed at the end of each billing period based on what is covered by the contract (standardized billing). You specify this setting in the '''Billing Type''' box of the '''Billing Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab.
*The type of the documents to be generated for the service contract: If schedules will be created for the contract, you specify whether service orders or appointments will be generated for the schedules in the '''Schedule Generation Type''' box (in the '''Contract Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab). For standardized billing contracts, if schedules will not be created, in the '''Schedule Generation Type''' box, you specify ''None'', indicating that no documents will be generated.
*The customer account to which invoices will be sent: By default, the invoices are sent to the customer account related to the service order but you can change the account in the '''Contract Billing Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab.
*The master contract (optional): You can specify the master contract to which this service contract is related in the '''Master Contract''' box in the Summary area.
*The vendor (optional): If a vendor rather than a staff member delivers services, you can specify the vendor in the '''Vendor''' box in the '''Contract Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab.
*The commission information (optional): If a salesperson is involved, you specify the commission settings in the '''Contract Settings''' section on the '''Summary''' tab.
*The attributes (optional): If additional properties have to be specified for the service contract, you specify or modify the values for the attributes on the '''Attributes''' tab. You have to specify values for the attributes for which the '''Required''' check box is selected. When a new service contract is created, the system populates this tab with the attributes defined for the ''Service Contract'' entity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_20_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000]) form.

==Information to Be Specified in the As-Performed Contract==
For as-performed billing contracts (that is, contracts that have the ''As-Performed Billings'' billing type), you create at least one schedule for the services that need to be performed, and you can then generate service orders or appointments for the customer according to the schedule. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_SC_Schedules|Service Contract Schedules] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Generating_SO|Generation of a Service Order or an Appointment ].{br}

When the schedules are created for the contract, if the prices specified in the contract should be used (that is, ''Contract'' is selected in the '''Take Prices From''' box of the '''As-Performed Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form, you have to specify the prices on the '''Service Prices''' and '''Inventory Item Prices''' tabs (if stock items will be sold during the appointments).
==Information to Be Specified in the Standardized Billing Contract==
For standardized billing contracts (that is, contracts that have the ''Standardized Plus Usage/Overage Billings'' billing type), you have to define the billing period in the '''Period''' box in the '''Standardized Billing Settings''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form. You can select one of the following options: ''Week'', ''Month'', ''Quarter'', ''Half a Year'', and ''Year''.{br}

On the '''Services per Period''' tab, you add services and non-stock items that are covered during each billing period. For each item, you specify the quantity in the '''Amount''' column and the price that is paid for the specified quantity of items in the '''Recurring Item Price''' column. You also specify the price for the case when the specified quantity has been exceeded during the period in the '''Overage Item Price''' column.{br}

If necessary, you can change the billing rule for each item in the '''Billing Rule''' column of the '''Services per Period''' tab and specify the related target equipment in the '''Target Equipment ID''' column.

In Acumatica ERP, you have to activate a service contract in the system to be able to generate appointments, service orders, and invoices for the contract. You can activate a draft of a contract that hasn&rsquo;t previously been used or activate a previously suspended contract. You cannot change the billing type or date information of an active service contract. {br}

In this topic, you will read about activation of the draft contracts and suspended contracts.{br}{TOC}
==Activating a Service Contract with the Draft Status==
When you create a service contract in the system, the contract is automatically assigned the ''Draft'' status. When you finish entering the necessary information for the contract, you should activate the contract so that you can generate service orders, appointments, or invoices for it. {br}

You activate the contract on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Activate Contract''' on the form toolbar. The system changes the status of the service contract to ''Active''. {br}

For detailed instructions on how to activate contracts, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Activate_Contract#_96653242-4b7c-4b47-bccd-c7f680d0999a|To Activate a Service Contract with the Draft Status].[anchor|#_ff470669-3512-4570-add7-5229f8ea2b44]
==Activating a Service Contract with the Suspended Status==
Contracts with the ''Suspended'' status can be activated again starting on a particular date (whether or not it is the current date). To activate a suspended service contract, you open the necessary contract on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form and click '''Actions''' > '''Activate Contract''' on the form toolbar. The system opens the '''Activation Contract''' dialog box, in which you specify the starting date when the contract has to be activated.{br}

If schedules have been generated for the service contract, you can view them in the table of the '''Activation Contract''' dialog box. You can change the date of the service orders or appointments to be generated when the contract is active. To do so, for each schedule, you select the check box in the '''Change Recurrence''' column. You then specify the date since which the service orders or appointments will be generated according to the schedule for the active contract in the '''Effective Recurrence Start Date''' column. The system recalculates the '''Next Execution''' date.{br}

If the activation date is later than the current date, when you click '''OK''' to close the dialog box and return to the form, the '''Upcoming Status''' box contains ''Active'' (indicating that the service contract will be active) and the '''Effective Until Date''' box contains the activation date (indicating that the current status of ''Suspended'' is effective until the activation date.{br}

For detailed instructions on how to activate contracts, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Activate_Contract#_a1a6e062-9051-4133-b76e-baf861009651|To Activate a Service Contract with the Suspended Status].

In Acumatica ERP, if you know a particular date in the future when a service contract is going to be activated, canceled, or suspended, you can set its upcoming status and the date when the status is effective in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form. If a contract has the expiration date, when you are entering the service contract into the system, the system sets ''Expired'' as the upcoming status. For details see, [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Activation|Activation of a Service Contract], [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Suspension|Suspension of a Service Contract], [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Cancellation|Cancellation of a Service Contract], and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Contract_Creation|Entry of the Service Contract].{br}

The system does not change the current status to upcoming automatically when the effective date has come. You can update the status manually or use an automation schedule to update it.
==Updating a Status Manually==
To change the current status to upcoming (whose effective date came) of one or multiple service contracts, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_12_00|Process Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS501200|FS501200]) form. On this form, you select the ''Update Upcoming Status'' option in the '''Action''' box of the form; you then specify the selection criteria to display the necessary service contract (or multiple contracts) and process the contract or contracts. The system updates the statuses of the processed contracts. For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Update_Statuses_of_Contracts|To Update the Statuses of Multiple Contracts].{br}

 Acumatica ERP provides an automation schedule to automatically invoke this action, as the section below explains.
==Updating the Status by Automation Schedule==
To automatically invoke the ''Update Upcoming Status'' action for contracts in the system, the ''Update Service Contracts Status'' automation schedule has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=SM205020|SM205020]) form. You should ensure that this schedule is active in the system (that is, make sure the '''Active''' check box is selected for the schedule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_50_20|Automation Schedules] form).{br}

This schedule runs daily, and you can modify this schedule if necessary. For details on automation schedules, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing].

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
With Acumatica ERP, you can manage the schedules of the service contracts. A schedule of the contract defines the services, inventory items, and other settings that the generated service order or appointment will have, as well as the recurrence of the generation. Based on the specified schedules, the service orders or appointments are generated for a customer.{br}

In this topic, you will read about creating a schedule and specifying its settings.
==Creating a Service Contract Schedule==
You create a new service contract schedule by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) form. You can navigate directly to this form or open it from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) form by clicking '''Add Schedule''' on the table toolbar of the '''Schedules''' tab. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] form, you select the customer and service contract number (if you didn't navigate from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] form, which causes this number to be filled in with the number of the service contract you were viewing), the customer location related to the schedule, and the service order type of the service orders or appointments that will be generated according to the schedule. You can also define the date range of the schedule. You then specify the following information:[anchor|#_5838e35e-58b3-4073-b579-f1b0c9783baa]
*The services that are delivered
*Any inventory items involved in the process of performing services
*The schedule settings
*(Optional) The values of the attributes related to the service orders or appointments generated from the schedule

For details on how to add a schedule, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_Schedule|To Add a Schedule].{br}

For each contract, you can create one schedule or multiple schedules. The system generates reference numbers for schedules based on the reference number of the related service contract and the sequence number of the schedule created for this service contract (''1'' for the first schedule, ''2'' for the second, and so on). For example, if the service contract has the reference number ''000001'' in the system and you create the first schedule for this service contract, the reference number of the schedule will be ''000001-1''. You can view the list of created schedules for a particular service contract on the '''Schedules''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] form.[anchor|#_52d6d59c-7f64-4c98-bad3-b30206db5aad]
==Defining Schedule Settings==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) form, for each schedule, you have to specify the recurrence frequency type and the schedule settings. Frequency-type recurrence settings define how often the schedule applies. You can select one of the following options: [anchor|#_9d9c526a-5e17-4382-a20a-e5ec46e5bf56]
*'''Daily''': The schedule applies daily or every ''x'' days.
*'''Weekly''': The schedule applies weekly or every ''x'' weeks.
*'''Monthly''': The schedule applies monthly or every ''x'' months.
*'''Yearly''': The schedule applies yearly or every ''x'' years.
{br}

When you select the frequency type, you have to specify settings for the selected type as follows:[anchor|#ul_nxx_nrf_px]
*If you have selected the '''Daily''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in days when the schedule applies. For example, if you specify every 1 day, the schedule applies every day, and if you specify every 2 days, the schedule applies every other day.
*If you have selected the '''Weekly''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in weeks and the day or days of the week when the schedule applies. For example, if you specify every 2 weeks and select Monday, the schedule applies Monday of every other week.
*If you have selected the '''Monthly''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in months and the day or days of the month when the schedule applies. There are two options for specifying the day: by the number of the day of the month, or by the week of the month and the day of the week. For example, you can specify that the schedule repeats every 2 months on the 2nd day of the month, or on the 2nd Monday of the month. You can specify up to four days for the '''Monthly''' frequency type.
*If you have selected the '''Yearly''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in years, the month or months of the year, and the day of the month when the schedule applies. There are two options for specifying the day of the month: by the number of the day of the month (for example, every 2 years on the 2nd day of February and March), or by the week of the month and the day of the week (for example, every year on the 2nd Monday of February and March). 
{br}

If the '''Enable Seasons Option in Schedule Contracts''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form, you can also specify the months when the schedule is applicable for the '''Daily''', '''Weekly''', and '''Monthly''' frequency types in the '''Season Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] form.
==Example of Schedule Settings Being Applied==
Suppose that according to a contract, your company has to perform maintenance services for a particular customer the first day of every month. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] form, you specify the service order type associated with maintenance services, and then you define the settings of the service contract schedule on the '''Recurrence''' tab of the form as follows:[anchor|#_9378a14e-27b3-4324-bb1c-68f3e40e1b84]
#You specify the frequency type of schedule recurrence as '''Monthly''' (that is, you select this option button under '''Frequency Type''').
#In the '''Monthly''' section, you specify the time interval when the schedule applies as '''Every 1 Month(s)'''.
#Under '''Schedule On''', you select the '''Fixed Day of Month''' option button and select ''1'' in the related box.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Service Contract Schedules With  Acumatica ERP,     you can manage the schedules of the service contracts. A schedule of the contract defines the     services, inventory items, and other settings that the generated service order or appointment     will have, as well as the recurrence of the generation. Based on the specified schedules, the     service orders or appointments are generated for a customer. In this topic, you will read about creating a schedule and specifying its settings. Creating a Service Contract Schedule You create a new service contract schedule by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) Service Contract Schedules     (FS305100) form. You can navigate directly to this form or open it from the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) Service Contracts (FS305700) form by clicking  Add Schedule  on     the table toolbar of the  Schedules  tab. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) Service Contract Schedules form, you select the customer and service contract number (if you     didn't navigate from the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) Service Contracts form, which causes this number to be     filled in with the number of the service contract you were viewing), the customer location     related to the schedule, and the service order type of the service orders or appointments that     will be generated according to the schedule. You can also define the date range of the schedule.     You then specify the following information: The services that are delivered Any inventory items involved in the process of performing services The schedule settings (Optional) The values of the attributes related to the service orders or appointments      generated from the schedule For details on how to add a schedule, see  To Add a Schedule. For each contract, you can create one schedule or multiple schedules. The system generates     reference numbers for schedules based on the reference number of the related service contract     and the sequence number of the schedule created for this service contract ( 1  for the     first schedule,  2  for the second, and so on). For example, if the service contract has     the reference number  000001  in the system and you create the first schedule for this     service contract, the reference number of the schedule will be  000001-1 . You can view the     list of created schedules for a particular service contract on the       Schedules  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) Service Contracts form. Defining Schedule Settings On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) Service Contract Schedules (FS305100) form, for each schedule, you have to     specify the recurrence frequency type and the schedule settings. Frequency-type recurrence     settings define how often the schedule applies. You can select one of the following options:  Daily : The schedule applies daily or every  x  days. Weekly : The schedule applies weekly or every  x  weeks. Monthly : The schedule applies monthly or every  x  months. Yearly : The schedule applies yearly or every  x  years. When you select the frequency type, you have to specify settings for the selected type as      follows: If you have selected the  Daily  frequency type, you have to specify       the time interval in days when the schedule applies. For example, if you specify every 1 day,       the schedule applies every day, and if you specify every 2 days, the schedule applies every       other day. If you have selected the  Weekly  frequency type, you have to specify       the time interval in weeks and the day or days of the week when the schedule applies. For       example, if you specify every 2 weeks and select Monday, the schedule applies Monday of every       other week. If you have selected the  Monthly  frequency type, you have to specify       the time interval in months and the day or days of the month when the schedule applies. There       are two options for specifying the day: by the number of the day of the month, or by the week       of the month and the day of the week. For example, you can specify that the schedule repeats       every 2 months on the 2nd day of the month, or on the 2nd Monday of the month. You can specify       up to four days for the  Monthly  frequency type. If you have selected the  Yearly  frequency type, you have to specify       the time interval in years, the month or months of the year, and the day of the month when the       schedule applies. There are two options for specifying the day of the month: by the number of       the day of the month (for example, every 2 years on the 2nd day of February and March), or by       the week of the month and the day of the week (for example, every year on the 2nd Monday of       February and March).  If the  Enable Seasons Option in Schedule Contracts  check box is     selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form, you can also specify the     months when the schedule is applicable for the  Daily ,       Weekly , and  Monthly  frequency types in the       Season Settings  section of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) Service Contract Schedules form. Example of Schedule Settings Being Applied Suppose that according to a contract, your company has to perform maintenance services for a     particular customer the first day of every month. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) Service Contract Schedules form,     you specify the service order type associated with maintenance services, and then you define the     settings of the service contract schedule on the  Recurrence  tab of the     form as follows: You specify the frequency type of schedule recurrence as  Monthly        (that is, you select this option button under  Frequency Type ). In the  Monthly  section, you specify the time interval when the       schedule applies as  Every 1 Month(s) . Under  Schedule On , you select the  Fixed Day of        Month  option button and select  1  in the related box. On the  Recurrence  tab of the form (right of  Frequency      Type ), you see the description of your schedule recurrence:  Occurs Every 1      Month(s) on 1st day of that month . You can view the days of recurrence of the schedule     (that is, the days when the service orders or appointments are generated according to this     schedule if the generation process is performed) on the  Forecast  tab of     the form. For details on generating service orders or appointments, see  Generation of a Service Order or an Appointment .  ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, the final step of processing a service contract with as-performed billing is generating the service orders or appointments for the contract.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how the service orders or appointments are generated for the contract and how the generation process can be canceled in the system.{br}{TOC}
==Generating Service Orders or Appointments==
Depending on the schedule generation type of the contract, you generate the service orders or appointments according to the service contract schedules you have created. You can generate service orders or appointments manually or create an automation schedule to generate the service orders or appointments. For more information on automation, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing].{br}

To generate schedules manually, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_03_00|Generate from Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500300|FS500300]) form. You can navigate directly to this form, or you can navigate to this form from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) form by clicking the '''Generate from Service Contracts''' button on the form toolbar. (This button becomes available after you have specified the schedule recurrence settings and saved the service contract schedule.) {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_03_00|Generate from Service Contracts] form, you can filter the list of service contracts by customer, customer location, branch, and branch location; you have to select the date up to which you want to generate schedules in the system. You can then generate all listed service contract schedules or only those you select. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_generate_a_staff_schedule|To Generate Staff Schedules].{br}

Once you have generated schedules, you can modify and process the generated service orders or appointments. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Service_Order_Processing|Service Order Processing Workflow].
==Viewing Generation Processes==
You can view information about the generation process, such as the date until which the service orders or appointments are generated and the date when the service orders or appointments were generated, on the '''Run History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_03_00|Generate from Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500300|FS500300]) form.

For the service contracts with standardized billing, at the end of each billing period, you have to generate a billing document (that is, an AR invoice or sales order) for the customer. The document includes the services and non-stock items that are covered by the contract, as well as other items included in the appointments related to the contract that were performed during the billing period. For the items that are covered by the contract, the document includes the price specified in the contract. If quantity of the items has been exceeded during the period, the overage quantity of items is included in the billing document with the overage price specified for the contract.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how to generate billing documents for the service contracts with standardized billing in the system.{br}{TOC}
==Generating Invoices and Creating Batches==
You specify the invoice generation settings (such as the type of the document to be generated) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_03_00|Equipment Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100300|FS100300]) form, as described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CNF_Overview_Equipment#_f3e82e76-f315-48e2-aecf-e2d8df20afa8|Configuration of Invoice Generation Settings].{br}

You generate the billing documents on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_13_00|Generate Invoices from Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS501300|FS501300]) form. You specify the date of document creation, select all listed service contracts for which you want to bill a customer or multiple customers, and generate the documents. For details on how to generate billing documents, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Generate_Invoice_for_Contract|To Generate Billing Documents for Contracts with Standardized Billing]. {br}

When you generate these billing documents, the system creates a batch of generated billing documents on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_61_00|Contract Invoice Generation Batches] ([~/?ScreenId=FS306100|FS306100]) form. The system assigns the batch a reference number in accordance with the numbering sequence assigned to batches in the '''Posting Batch Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_13_00|Generate Invoices from Contracts] form, you click the batch number in the '''Batch Nbr.''' column to view information on the batch. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_61_00|Contract Invoice Generation Batches] ([~/?ScreenId=FS306100|FS306100]) form with the batch. On this form, you can find the contract reference number, the invoice date, the customer, the branch, and the next billing date for the contract.
==Processing Billing Documents==
The appropriate employees process the generated billing documents. To open a generated billing document for the selected batch, you click the billing document number in the '''Document Nbr.''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_61_00|Contract Invoice Generation Batches] ([~/?ScreenId=FS306100|FS306100]) form, and then process it in the system.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, while you are working with a sales order, service order, or appointment on the applicable form, you can easily register the sale of model equipment entities.{br}

For the use case considered in this topic, suppose that the customer has requested a model equipment entity, along with installation services from your company. A service manager of your company then receives the request and enters it into Acumatica ERP. Further processing is then performed by the scheduler, the assigned staff members, and the accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes them in the system.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the service order along with the sale of the target equipment.
==Applying the System Settings of the Use Case==
In this example, settings are applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By'''). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].
*For the service order type, on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, the applicable service order type is configured as follows:
**In the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section, the option button to create sales orders ('''Sales Order''' under '''Generate Invoices In''') is selected.
**In the '''General Settings''' section, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Completed''' check box is selected, so that service orders of the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed. Also, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Closed''' check box is selected, meaning that service orders of the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed.
{br}

In the diagram below, you can see the entire process of selling model equipment within a service order.[anchor|#_9a9196f2-f739-4d1e-b2b1-b94f000c99ef][anchor|#_b361f365-3b2e-4580-9a27-532df0d6558c][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Selling_Model_Equipment.png|popup|Selling an entity of model equipment within a service order|450px]
In the following sections, you will read about each step of the process.
==Entering an Order==
When a service manager receives a customer request, he or she enters a service order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the service order, the service manager specifies the customer from which the request has been received, the branch and branch location where the services are delivered, the services that should be performed. For instructions on how to create a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_SO|To Create a Service Order].{br}

In addition, on the '''Inventory Item''' tab of this form, the service manager adds a model equipment entity that is sold. For the model equipment entity, the service manager selects ''Selling Model Equipment'' in the '''Equipment Action''' column. For instructions on how to add equipment for sale, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Sell_Model_Equipment|To Add a Model Equipment Sale to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order].[anchor|#_e278356e-dec7-46b7-ba7f-26e6c519aeb8]
==Creating Appointments==
After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer. {br}

When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the service. (The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to the created appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].[anchor|#_6adff3c0-3823-4255-8af5-a7efd7d88261]
==Attending an Appointment==
The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the ''In Process'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. When the services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4), which gives it the ''Completed'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.[anchor|#_9b0ac57d-2514-419a-88f3-2517e5031ec6]
==Processing Invoices==
Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, the accountant opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service order (5). (The appointments and service order get the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].{br}

The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (6 in the diagram above). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].{br}

The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and processes and releases the invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form (8).{br}

When the invoice related to the service order is released, the sold model equipment converts to a target equipment, and the system adds a record for the new target equipment entity with the ''Active'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Selling Model Equipment In  Acumatica ERP,     while you are working with a sales order, service order, or appointment on the applicable form,     you can easily register the sale of model equipment entities. For the use case considered in this topic, suppose that the customer has requested a model     equipment entity, along with installation services from your company. A service manager of your     company then receives the request and enters it into  Acumatica ERP.     Further processing is then performed by the scheduler, the assigned staff members, and the     accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes them in the system. In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the service order along     with the sale of the target equipment. Applying the System Settings of the Use Case In this example, settings are applied in the system as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) Billing Cycles (FS206000) form, the billing                 cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by                 appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the  Appointments                  option button is selected under both  Generate Invoices From                  and  Group Invoices By ). For details, see  To Add a Billing Cycle and  To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer. For the service order type, on the  Preferences  tab of the                       ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form, the applicable                 service order type is configured as follows: In the  Invoice Generation Settings  section, the                         option button to create sales orders ( Sales Order                          under  Generate Invoices In ) is selected. In the  General Settings  section, the                              Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Completed  check box is selected, so that service orders of                         the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed.                         Also, the  Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Closed  check box is selected, meaning that service orders of                         the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed. In the diagram below, you can see the entire process of selling model equipment within a     service order. Selling an entity of model equipment within a service order In the following sections, you will read about each step of the process. Entering an Order When a service manager receives a customer request, he or she enters a service order by using     the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the     service order, the service manager specifies the customer from which the request has been     received, the branch and branch location where the services are delivered, the services that     should be performed. For instructions on how to create a service order, see  To Create a Service Order. In addition, on the  Inventory Item  tab of this form, the service     manager adds a model equipment entity that is sold. For the model equipment entity, the service     manager selects  Selling Model Equipment  in the  Equipment Action      column. For instructions on how to add equipment for sale, see  To Add a Model Equipment Sale to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order. Creating Appointments After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a                 person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form to schedule the                 appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services                 requested by the customer.  When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into                 consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff                 members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service                 area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each                 appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used                 to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the                 service. (The system assigns the  Not Started  status to the created                 appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see  To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board. Attending an Appointment The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming                 appointments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board (FS300400) form,                 identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the                 location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer                 location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form                 (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the  In Process  status.                 For details, see  To Start an Appointment. While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on                 services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form. When the                 services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When                 everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4),                 which gives it the  Completed  status. For details, see  To Complete an Appointment. When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns                 the service order the  Completed  status. Processing Invoices Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form, the accountant opens the completed     appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the     appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service     order (5). (The appointments and service order get the  Closed  status.) For details, see       To Close an Appointment and  To Close Service Orders. The accountant generates a sales order document with the  Open  status by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) Generate Invoices from Appointments (FS500100) form (6 in the diagram above). For details,     see  To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments. The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and processes and releases the invoice     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form (8). When the invoice related to the service order is released, the sold model equipment converts         to a target equipment, and the system adds a record for the new target equipment entity with         the  Active  status on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS205000)         form.

In Acumatica ERP, while you are working with a sales order, service order, or appointment on the applicable form, you can easily register the sale of model equipment entities and optional components of it.{br}

For the use case considered in this topic, suppose that the customer has requested a model equipment entity and an optional component for it, along with installation services from your company. A service manager of your company receives the request and enters it into Acumatica ERP. Further processing is then performed by the scheduler, the assigned staff members, and the accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes them in the system.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the service order that includes the sale of model equipment and its optional component.
==Applying the System Settings of the Use Case==
In this example, settings are applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By'''). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].

In the diagram below, you can see the entire process of selling model equipment and its optional component within a service order.[anchor|#_9a9196f2-f739-4d1e-b2b1-b94f000c99ef][anchor|#_bb4b8a9a-854e-4875-9702-88e8f7ac6a27][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Selling_Optional_Component_Model_Equipment.png|popup|Selling model equipment and its optional component within a service order|450px]
In the following sections, you will read about each step of the process.
==Entering an Order==
When a service manager receives a customer request, he or she enters a service order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the service order, the service manager specifies the customer from which the request has been received, the branch and branch location where the services are delivered, the services that should be performed. For instructions on how to create a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_SO|To Create a Service Order].{br}

In addition, on the '''Inventory Item''' tab of this form, the service manager adds the model equipment entity and the optional component to be sold as follows:[anchor|#_e12a40f6-6cbc-46da-8654-1cf978ea36da]
#For the model equipment entity, the service manager selects ''Selling Model Equipment'' in the '''Equipment Action''' column. For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Sell_Model_Equipment|To Add a Model Equipment Sale to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order].

For instructions on how to add a component, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Sell_Optional_Component|To Add a Sale of Optional Components to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order].
[anchor|#_57246acc-aa99-4ded-a9ac-e631d8c188cf]
==Creating Appointments==
After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer. {br}

When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the service. (The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to the created appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].[anchor|#_3bf233e9-f70d-4e53-8f5e-4c3c9d3f805d]
==Attending an Appointment==
The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the ''In Process'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. When the services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4), which gives it the ''Completed'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.[anchor|#_9b0ac57d-2514-419a-88f3-2517e5031ec6]
==Processing Invoices==
Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, the accountant opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service order (5). (The appointments and service order get the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].{br}

The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (6 in the diagram above). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].{br}

The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and processes and releases the invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form (8).{br}

When the invoice related to the service order is released, the system automatically adds a record for the new target equipment entity with the ''Active'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form, including an optional component of the ''Active'' status on the '''Components and Warranties''' tab.

In addition, on the  Inventory Item  tab of this form, the service     manager adds the model equipment entity and the optional component to be sold as follows: For the model equipment entity, the service manager selects  Selling Model Equipment       in the  Equipment Action  column. For detailed instructions, see  To Add a Model Equipment Sale to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order. For the optional component, the service manager selects  Selling Optional Component  in      the  Equipment Action  column, specifies the related model equipment in      the  Model Equipment Line Nbr.  column, and selects the identifier of the      equipment component in the  Component ID  column. For instructions on how      to add a component, see  To Add a Sale of Optional Components to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order. Creating Appointments After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a                 person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form to schedule the                 appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services                 requested by the customer.  When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into                 consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff                 members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service                 area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each                 appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used                 to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the                 service. (The system assigns the  Not Started  status to the created                 appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see  To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board. Attending an Appointment The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming                 appointments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board (FS300400) form,                 identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the                 location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer                 location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form                 (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the  In Process  status.                 For details, see  To Start an Appointment. While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on                 services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form. When the                 services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When                 everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4),                 which gives it the  Completed  status. For details, see  To Complete an Appointment. When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns                 the service order the  Completed  status. Processing Invoices Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form, the accountant opens the completed     appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the     appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service     order (5). (The appointments and service order get the  Closed  status.) For details, see       To Close an Appointment and  To Close Service Orders. The accountant generates a sales order document with the  Open  status by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) Generate Invoices from Appointments (FS500100) form (6 in the diagram above). For         details, see  To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments. The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and processes and releases the         invoice on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form (8). When the invoice related to the service order is released, the system automatically adds a         record for the new target equipment entity with the  Active  status on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS205000) form, including an optional component         of the  Active  status on the  Components and Warranties  tab.  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, while you are working with a sales order, service order, or appointment on the applicable form, you can easily register a sale of an optional component of target equipment.{br}

For the use case considered in this topic, suppose that the customer has requested that an optional component of target equipment (which the company already has) be installed at the customer site, along with installation services from your company. A service manager of your company receives the request and enters it into Acumatica ERP. Further processing is then performed by the scheduler, the assigned staff members, and the accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes them in the system.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the service order that includes the sale of an optional component of target equipment.
==Applying the System Settings of the Use Case==
In this example, settings are applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By'''). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].
*For the service order type, on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, the applicable service order type is configured as follows:
**In the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section, the option button to create sales orders ('''Sales Order''' under '''Generate Invoices In''') is selected.
**In the '''General Settings''' section, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Completed''' check box is selected, so that service orders of the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed. Also, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Closed''' check box is selected, meaning that service orders of the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed.
{br}

In the diagram below, you can see the entire process of selling an optional component of target equipment within a service order.[anchor|#_909999cf-058b-4780-bc44-eb62ea3f5626][anchor|#_4da6b3b5-7b63-4f94-b3e3-4bfa24c03d61][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Selling_Optional_Component_Target_Equipment.png|popup|Selling an optional component of target equipment within a service order|450px]
In the following sections, you will read about each step of the process.
==Entering an Order==
When a service manager receives a customer request, he or she enters a service order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the service order, the service manager specifies the customer from which the request has been received, the branch and branch location where the services are delivered, the services that should be performed. For instructions on how to create a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_SO|To Create a Service Order].{br}

In addition, on the '''Inventory Item''' tab of this form, the service manager adds the optional component to be sold. For the optional component, the service manager selects ''Selling Optional Component'' in the '''Equipment Action''' column, specifies the related target equipment in the '''Target Equipment ID''' column, and selects the identifier of the equipment component in the '''Component ID''' column. For instructions on how to add a component, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Sell_Optional_Component|To Add a Sale of Optional Components to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order].[anchor|#_01dc8a36-4f7a-4c2c-ae1a-d853b1ec7e03]
==Creating Appointments==
After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer. {br}

When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the service. (The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to the created appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].[anchor|#_249a11ea-d22e-4f26-9f27-a9e3073aac6d]
==Attending an Appointment==
The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the ''In Process'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. When the services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4), which gives it the ''Completed'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.[anchor|#_9b0ac57d-2514-419a-88f3-2517e5031ec6]
==Processing Invoices==
Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, the accountant opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service order (5). (The appointments and service order get the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].{br}

The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (6 in the diagram above). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].{br}

The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and processes and releases the invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form (8).{br}

When the invoices related to the service order is released, the system automatically adds a component with the ''Active'' status to the target equipment record on the '''Components and Warranties''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form.

In the diagram below, you can see the entire process of selling a piece of model equipment and upgrading a default component of model equipment within a service order.[anchor|#_00a845e3-da6a-4138-bfb9-da560cb96f88][anchor|#_52871d34-ac52-4697-bb71-17607ebaf51c][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Upgrading_Component.png|popup|Selling model equipment and upgrading a default component within a service order|450px]
In the following sections, you will read about each step of the process.
==Entering an Order==
When a service manager receives a customer request, he or she enters a service order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the service order, the service manager specifies the customer from which the request has been received, the branch and branch location where the services are delivered, the services that should be performed. For instructions on how to create a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_SO|To Create a Service Order].{br}

In addition, on the '''Inventory Item''' tab of this form, the service manager adds the model equipment entity and the component to be sold as follows: [anchor|#_2a4fac68-dd15-41df-baec-8416a854e78a]
#For the model equipment entity, the service manager selects ''Selling Model Equipment'' in the '''Equipment Action''' column. For instructions on how to add equipment for sale, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Sell_Model_Equipment|To Add a Model Equipment Sale to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order].
#For the component, the service manager selects ''Upgrading Component'' in the '''Equipment Action''' column, specifies the related model equipment in the '''Model Equipment Line Nbr.''' column, and selects the identifier of the equipment component in the '''Component ID''' column. For instructions on how to add a component, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Upgrade_Equipment|To Add Upgraded Components to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order].
[anchor|#_02d02ffe-c565-4ee0-ba60-8a0711decb8c]
==Creating Appointments==
After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer. {br}

When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the service. (The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to the created appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].[anchor|#_55179281-506b-4a54-86a3-562ed90fb0a5]
==Attending an Appointment==
The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the ''In Process'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. When the services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4), which gives it the ''Completed'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.[anchor|#_9b0ac57d-2514-419a-88f3-2517e5031ec6]
==Processing Invoices==
Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, the accountant opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service order (5). (The appointments and service order get the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].{br}

The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (6 in the diagram above). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].{br}

The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and processes and releases the invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form (8).{br}

When the invoice related to the service order is released, the system adds a record for the new target equipment entity with the ''Active'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form, including a new component of the ''Active'' status on the '''Components and Warranties''' tab.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Upgrading a Default Component of Model Equipment to Be Sold In  Acumatica ERP,     while you are working with a sales order, service order, or appointment on the applicable form,     you can easily register the sale of model equipment and replacement of a default component in     it. For the use case considered in this topic, suppose that the customer has requested a model     equipment entity and a replacement of one of the default components of this equipment entity,     along with installation services from your company. A service manager of your company receives     the request and enters it into  Acumatica ERP.     Further processing is then performed by the scheduler, the assigned staff members, and the     accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes them in the system. In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the service order that     includes the sale of model equipment and the upgrade of its default component. Applying the System Settings of the Use Case In this example, settings are applied in the system as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) Billing Cycles (FS206000) form, the billing                 cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by                 appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the  Appointments                  option button is selected under both  Generate Invoices From                  and  Group Invoices By ). For details, see  To Add a Billing Cycle and  To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer. For the service order type, on the  Preferences  tab of the                       ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form, the applicable                 service order type is configured as follows: In the  Invoice Generation Settings  section, the                         option button to create sales orders ( Sales Order                          under  Generate Invoices In ) is selected. In the  General Settings  section, the                              Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Completed  check box is selected, so that service orders of                         the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed.                         Also, the  Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Closed  check box is selected, meaning that service orders of                         the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed. In the diagram below, you can see the entire process of selling a piece of model equipment and     upgrading a default component of model equipment within a service order. Selling model equipment and upgrading a default component within a service order In the following sections, you will read about each step of the process. Entering an Order When a service manager receives a customer request, he or she enters a service order by using     the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the     service order, the service manager specifies the customer from which the request has been     received, the branch and branch location where the services are delivered, the services that     should be performed. For instructions on how to create a service order, see  To Create a Service Order. In addition, on the  Inventory Item  tab of this form, the service     manager adds the model equipment entity and the component to be sold as follows:  For the model equipment entity, the service manager selects  Selling Model Equipment       in the  Equipment Action  column. For instructions on how to add equipment      for sale, see  To Add a Model Equipment Sale to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order. For the component, the service manager selects  Upgrading Component  in the        Equipment Action  column, specifies the related model equipment in the        Model Equipment Line Nbr.  column, and selects the identifier of the      equipment component in the  Component ID  column. For instructions on how      to add a component, see  To Add Upgraded Components to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order. Creating Appointments After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a                 person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form to schedule the                 appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services                 requested by the customer.  When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into                 consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff                 members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service                 area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each                 appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used                 to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the                 service. (The system assigns the  Not Started  status to the created                 appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see  To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board. Attending an Appointment The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming                 appointments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board (FS300400) form,                 identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the                 location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer                 location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form                 (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the  In Process  status.                 For details, see  To Start an Appointment. While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on                 services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form. When the                 services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When                 everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4),                 which gives it the  Completed  status. For details, see  To Complete an Appointment. When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns                 the service order the  Completed  status. Processing Invoices Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form, the accountant opens the completed     appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the     appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service     order (5). (The appointments and service order get the  Closed  status.) For details, see       To Close an Appointment and  To Close Service Orders. The accountant generates a sales order document with the  Open  status by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) Generate Invoices from Appointments (FS500100) form (6 in the diagram above). For details,     see  To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments. The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and processes and releases the invoice     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form (8).

In Acumatica ERP, while you are working with a sales order, service order, or appointment on the applicable form, you can easily register the replacement of an existing target equipment entity with a new entity.{br}

For the use case considered in this topic, suppose that the customer has requested a new equipment entity to replace an old one, along with replacement services from your company. A service manager of your company receives the request and enters it into Acumatica ERP. Further processing is then performed by the scheduler, the assigned staff members, and the accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes them in the system.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the service order and replacing the target equipment.
==Applying the System Settings of the Use Case==
In this example, settings are applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By''').

In the diagram below, you can see the entire process of replacing target equipment within a service order.[anchor|#_53ebb85a-6391-4c98-992f-9a195c3b846f][anchor|#_eaa86455-a092-4f7b-8b81-3d9bbb84f6b0][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Target_Equipment_Replacement.png|popup|Replacing target equipment within a service order|450px]
In the following sections, you will read about each step of the process.
==Entering an Order==
When a service manager receives a customer request for replacement of target equipment, he or she enters a service order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the service order, the service manager specifies the customer from which the request has been received, the branch and branch location where the services are delivered, the services that should be performed. For instructions on how to create a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_SO|To Create a Service Order].{br}

In addition, on the '''Inventory Item''' tab of this form, the service manager adds a model equipment entity that will replace the old target equipment entity. To specify that the replacement is being performed, for the model equipment entity, the service manager selects ''Replacing Target Equipment'' in the '''Equipment Action''' column and specifies the target equipment entity to be replaced in the '''Target Equipment ID''' column. For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Replace_Target_Equipment|To Add Replacement Target Equipment to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order].[anchor|#_0c020f00-a36b-4f57-a77c-3fc790f8d0cf]
==Creating Appointments==
After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer. {br}

When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the service. (The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to the created appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].[anchor|#_43a65493-6f1e-44ad-a921-4a2e033b985d]
==Attending an Appointment==
The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the ''In Process'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. When the services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4), which gives it the ''Completed'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.[anchor|#_9b0ac57d-2514-419a-88f3-2517e5031ec6]
==Processing Invoices==
Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, the accountant opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service order (5). (The appointments and service order get the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].{br}

The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (6 in the diagram above). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].{br}

The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and processes and releases the invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form (8).{br}

When the invoice related to the service order is released, the system adds a record for the new target equipment entity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form and changes the status of replaced target equipment entity to ''Disposed'' on the same form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Replacing Target Equipment In  Acumatica ERP,     while you are working with a sales order, service order, or appointment on the applicable form,     you can easily register the replacement of an existing target equipment entity with a new     entity. For the use case considered in this topic, suppose that the customer has requested a new     equipment entity to replace an old one, along with replacement services from your company. A     service manager of your company receives the request and enters it into  Acumatica ERP.     Further processing is then performed by the scheduler, the assigned staff members, and the     accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes them in the system. In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the service order and     replacing the target equipment. Applying the System Settings of the Use Case In this example, settings are applied in the system as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) Billing Cycles (FS206000) form, the billing                 cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by                 appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the  Appointments                  option button is selected under both  Generate Invoices From                  and  Group Invoices By ). For details, see  To Add a Billing Cycle and  To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer. For the service order type, on the  Preferences  tab of the                       ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form, the applicable                 service order type is configured as follows: In the  Invoice Generation Settings  section, the                         option button to create sales orders ( Sales Order                          under  Generate Invoices In ) is selected. In the  General Settings  section, the                              Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Completed  check box is selected, so that service orders of                         the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed.                         Also, the  Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are                             Closed  check box is selected, meaning that service orders of                         the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed. In the diagram below, you can see the entire process of replacing target equipment within a     service order. Replacing target equipment within a service order In the following sections, you will read about each step of the process. Entering an Order When a service manager receives a customer request for replacement of target equipment, he or     she enters a service order by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form (see     1 in the diagram above). In the service order, the service manager specifies the customer from     which the request has been received, the branch and branch location where the services are     delivered, the services that should be performed. For instructions on how to create a service     order, see  To Create a Service Order. In addition, on the  Inventory Item  tab of this form, the service     manager adds a model equipment entity that will replace the old target equipment entity. To     specify that the replacement is being performed, for the model equipment entity, the service     manager selects  Replacing Target Equipment  in the  Equipment Action      column and specifies the target equipment entity to be replaced in the  Target      Equipment ID  column. For detailed instructions, see  To Add Replacement Target Equipment to a Service Order, Appointment, or Sales Order. Creating Appointments After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a                 person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form to schedule the                 appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services                 requested by the customer.  When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into                 consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff                 members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service                 area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each                 appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used                 to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the                 service. (The system assigns the  Not Started  status to the created                 appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see  To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board. Attending an Appointment The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming                 appointments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board (FS300400) form,                 identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the                 location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer                 location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form                 (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the  In Process  status.                 For details, see  To Start an Appointment. While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on                 services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form. When the                 services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When                 everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4),                 which gives it the  Completed  status. For details, see  To Complete an Appointment. When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns                 the service order the  Completed  status. Processing Invoices Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form, the accountant opens the completed     appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the     appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service     order (5). (The appointments and service order get the  Closed  status.) For details, see       To Close an Appointment and  To Close Service Orders. The accountant generates a sales order document with the  Open  status by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) Generate Invoices from Appointments (FS500100) form (6 in the diagram above). For details,     see  To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments. The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and processes and releases the invoice     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form (8). When the invoice related to the service order is released, the system adds a record for the     new target equipment entity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS205000)     form and changes the status of replaced target equipment entity to  Disposed  on the same     form.  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, while you are working with a sales order, service order, or appointment on the applicable form, you can register the replacement of components of target equipment with new components.{br}

For the use case considered in this topic, suppose that the customer has requested a new component to replace an old one in the existing target equipment, along with replacement services from your company. A service manager of your company receives the request and enters it into Acumatica ERP. Further processing is then performed by the scheduler, the assigned staff members, and the accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes them in the system.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in processing the service order and replacing the component.
==Applying the System Settings of the Use Case==
In this example, settings are applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By'''). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].
*For the service order type, on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, the applicable service order type is configured as follows:
**In the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section, the option button to create sales orders ('''Sales Order''' under '''Generate Invoices In''') is selected.
**In the '''General Settings''' section, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Completed''' check box is selected, so that service orders of the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed. Also, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Closed''' check box is selected, meaning that service orders of the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed.
{br}

In the diagram below, you can see the entire process of replacing a component of target equipment within a service order.[anchor|#_67a13c4b-062e-4aa4-937b-8f64ab5fdcbf][anchor|#_42737f2a-990b-470d-9187-e6981e9dd2c2][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Replacing_Component.png|popup|Replacing a component of target equipment|450px]
In the following sections, you will read about each step of the process.
==Entering an Order==
When a service manager receives a customer request for replacement of target equipment, he or she enters a service order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the service order, the service manager specifies the customer from which the request has been received, the branch and branch location where the services are delivered, the services that should be performed. For instructions on how to create a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_SO|To Create a Service Order].{br}

In addition, on the '''Inventory Item''' tab of this form, the service manager adds a component that will replace the old component. To specify that the replacement is performed, for the new component, the service manager selects ''Replacing Component'' in the '''Equipment Action''' column, specifies the target equipment entity in which the component has to be replaced in the '''Target Equipment ID''' column, and specifies the component to be replaced in the '''Component Line Ref.''' column. For instructions on how to add a component for replacement, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Replace_Components|To Replace Components in Target Equipment].[anchor|#_15dab74a-3cb3-4d35-9374-2037a7cee6a8]
==Creating Appointments==
After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer. {br}

When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the service. (The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to the created appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].[anchor|#_d263ffbc-0660-43eb-9953-08da5f1ec5dc]
==Attending an Appointment==
The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the ''In Process'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. When the services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4), which gives it the ''Completed'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.[anchor|#_9b0ac57d-2514-419a-88f3-2517e5031ec6]
==Processing Invoices==
Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, the accountant opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service order (5). (The appointments and service order get the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].{br}

The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (6 in the diagram above). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].{br}

The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and processes and releases the invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form (8).{br}

When the invoice related to the service order is released, the system modifies a record for the target equipment entity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form. That is, the system changes the status of replaced component to ''Disposed'' and adds a record for a new component on the '''Components and Warranties''' tab.

For instructions on how to add a component for replacement, see  To Replace Components in Target Equipment. Creating Appointments After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a                 person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form to schedule the                 appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services                 requested by the customer.  When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into                 consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff                 members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service                 area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each                 appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used                 to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the                 service. (The system assigns the  Not Started  status to the created                 appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see  To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board. Attending an Appointment The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming                 appointments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board (FS300400) form,                 identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the                 location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer                 location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form                 (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the  In Process  status.                 For details, see  To Start an Appointment. While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on                 services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form. When the                 services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When                 everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4),                 which gives it the  Completed  status. For details, see  To Complete an Appointment. When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns                 the service order the  Completed  status. Processing Invoices Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form, the accountant opens the completed     appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the     appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service     order (5). (The appointments and service order get the  Closed  status.) For details, see       To Close an Appointment and  To Close Service Orders. The accountant generates a sales order document with the  Open  status by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) Generate Invoices from Appointments (FS500100) form (6 in the diagram above).

The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and processes and releases the invoice     on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form (8). When the invoice related to the service order is released, the system modifies a record for     the target equipment entity on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS205000)     form. That is, the system changes the status of replaced component to  Disposed  and adds a     record for a new component on the  Components and Warranties  tab.

In Acumatica ERP, while employees are working with a sales order, service order, or appointment on the applicable form, they can reflect the sales of stock items without creating or modifying records in the Equipment Management functional area. {br}

For the use case to be considered in this topic, suppose that the customer has requested additional component of a target equipment. Your company is not going to keep record of the sold component in the system. The request is received and entered into Acumatica ERP by a service manager of your company. Further processing of a service order is then performed by the scheduler, the assigned staff members, and the accountant who prepares invoices for the customer and processes them in the system.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the steps involved in the processing of the service order that includes the sale of stock item that do not require recording in the system.
==Applying the System Settings of the Use Case==
In this example, settings are applied in the system as follows:[anchor|#_edf26950-50df-4235-ae3c-aa95abd0c503]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_60_00|Billing Cycles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS206000|FS206000]) form, the billing cycle assigned to the customer is configured to generate invoices and group them by appointment (that is, in the Summary area, the '''Appointments''' option button is selected under both '''Generate Invoices From''' and '''Group Invoices By'''). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_to_add_a_billing_cycle|To Add a Billing Cycle] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Assign_a_Billing_Cycle|To Assign Billing Cycles to a Customer].
*For the service order type, on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form, the applicable service order type is configured as follows:
**In the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section, the option button to create sales orders ('''Sales Order''' under '''Generate Invoices In''') is selected.
**In the '''General Settings''' section, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Completed''' check box is selected, so that service orders of the type are completed automatically when their appointments are completed. Also, the '''Complete Service Order When Its Appointments Are Closed''' check box is selected, meaning that service orders of the type are closed automatically when their appointments are closed.
{br}

In the diagram below, you can see the entire process of replacing target equipment within a service order.[anchor|#_dfb87a0e-13c3-4c79-a1db-cad3ee792e82][anchor|#_afed36df-f350-48c2-8164-07ee77278693][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__NA.png|popup|Selling a stock item that do not require recording in Equipment Management|450px]
In the following sections, you will read about each step of the process
==Entering an Order==
When a service manager receives a customer request, he or she enters a service order by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the service order, the service manager specifies the customer from which the request has been received, the branch and branch location where the services are delivered, and the services that should be performed. For instructions on how to create a service order, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_SO|To Create a Service Order].{br}

The service manager adds the stock item to be sold on the '''Inventory Items''' tab of this form and selects ''N/A'' in the '''Equipment Action''' column. {br}

In addition, the service manager adds the optional component to be sold on the '''Inventory Items''' tab. For the component, the service manager selects ''N/A'' in the '''Equipment Action''' column, specifies the related target equipment in the '''Target Equipment ID''' column, and selects the identifier of the equipment component in the '''Component ID''' column. [anchor|#_a2cd9b75-2248-41a2-94b8-fab95a563e41]
==Creating Appointments==
After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) form to schedule the appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services requested by the customer. {br}

When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the service. (The system assigns the ''Not Started'' status to the created appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Schedule|To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board].[anchor|#_2d809749-26e4-41d8-b3cf-c63225d37d7f]
==Attending an Appointment==
The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming appointments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_04_00| Staff Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400]) form, identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the ''In Process'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Appointment|To Start an Appointment].{br}

While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] form. When the services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4), which gives it the ''Completed'' status. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Complete_Appointment|To Complete an Appointment].{br}

When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns the service order the ''Completed'' status.[anchor|#_9b0ac57d-2514-419a-88f3-2517e5031ec6]
==Processing Invoices==
Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form, the accountant opens the completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the service order (5). (The appointments and service order get the ''Closed'' status.) For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Appointment|To Close an Appointment] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Service_Order|To Close Service Orders].{br}

The accountant generates a sales order document with the ''Open'' status by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_01_00|Generate Invoices from Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) form (6 in the diagram above). For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_ToInvoice_by_Appointment|To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments].{br}

The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, and processes and releases it on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form (8).{br}

When the invoice related to the service order is released, the system does not add any records on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form.

In the diagram below, you can see the entire process of replacing target equipment within a     service order. Selling a stock item that do not require recording in Equipment Management In the following sections, you will read about each step of the process Entering an Order When a service manager receives a customer request, he or she enters a service order by using         the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) form (see 1 in the diagram above). In the         service order, the service manager specifies the customer from which the request has been         received, the branch and branch location where the services are delivered, and the services         that should be performed. For instructions on how to create a service order, see  To Create a Service Order. The service manager adds the stock item to be sold on the  Inventory           Items  tab of this form and selects  N/A  in the  Equipment           Action  column.  In addition, the service manager adds the optional component to be sold on the            Inventory Items  tab. For the component, the service manager selects            N/A  in the  Equipment Action  column, specifies the related         target equipment in the  Target Equipment ID  column, and selects the         identifier of the equipment component in the  Component ID  column.  Creating Appointments After the service order has been created in the system, a scheduler of your company (that is, a                 person who is responsible for planning the appointments) uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) form to schedule the                 appointments (2 in the diagram above) that are needed to perform the services                 requested by the customer.  When the scheduler selects a staff member to attend an appointment, he or she takes into                 consideration the work schedule of the staff member and filters the displayed staff                 members by the skills and licenses needed to perform the service and the service                 area where the services are provided. The scheduler checks the information on each                 appointment and enters additional information, such as the resource equipment used                 to perform the services and the stock items purchased by the customer along with the                 service. (The system assigns the  Not Started  status to the created                 appointments.) For details on scheduling appointments, see  To Schedule an Appointment on the Calendar Board. Attending an Appointment The staff member who is assigned to an appointment looks through his or her upcoming                 appointments on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300400|FS300400])  Staff Calendar Board (FS300400) form,                 identifies which appointment he or she has to attend currently, and goes to the                 location where the service has to be performed, which usually is the customer                 location). When the staff member starts to perform the service, he or she starts the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form                 (3 in the diagram above). The appointment is assigned the  In Process  status.                 For details, see  To Start an Appointment. While the services are being performed, the staff member adds the information on                 services (such as statuses, quantities, and extra stock items that were used) to the                 appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments form. When the                 services are done, the staff member checks the details of the appointment. When                 everything is correct and complete, the staff member completes the appointment (4),                 which gives it the  Completed  status. For details, see  To Complete an Appointment. When all appointments of a particular service order are completed, the system assigns                 the service order the  Completed  status. Processing Invoices Further processing of the service order is performed by an accountant. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) form, the accountant opens the         completed appointment and verifies quantities and prices. When all information is verified         and the appointments are ready for invoicing, the accountant closes the appointments and the         service order (5). (The appointments and service order get the  Closed  status.) For         details, see  To Close an Appointment and  To Close Service Orders. The accountant generates a sales order document with the  Open  status by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500100|FS500100]) Generate Invoices from Appointments (FS500100) form (6 in the diagram above). For         details, see  To Generate Billing Documents from Appointments. The accountant then prepares the invoice (7) by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, and processes and releases it on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) form (8). When the invoice related to the service order is released, the system does not add any records         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) Equipment (FS205000) form.  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) ]]></column>

You use the Route Management module to plan and manage your organization&rsquo;s routes and the route services (that is, the services provided when each route is executed), along with processing the contracts related to the routes. In the system, you create the general routes, and for each particular execution of the route, you create route executions. Each stop in the route execution is a route appointment—that is, an appointment with a service order type of the ''Route'' behavior. Each route execution is based on a particular route and inherits some of its settings. {br}

You can track your executed routes by using Bing maps and get the statistics on each execution of a route, such as the distance and the time needed to execute the route. With the integration between the Route Management module and the Service Management module of Acumatica ERP, you can create appointments related to route executions and generate invoices for services that have been provided. {br}

You use the forms of the Route Management module to perform a variety of procedures related to processing routes and related documents and entities. These procedures are briefly described in the following sections of this topic.{br}{TOC}
==Integrating the Route Management Module with Other Modules==
Each route execution created or generated in the Route Management module has appointments (which are related to service orders) that have been created in the Service Management module. After the appointments and the route execution are completed or closed, you can generate billing documents in the appropriate module, depending on the settings of the Service Management module. The following options are available:[anchor|#_93934a70-513c-4090-a6a8-147c4ad3ce39]
*Generating documents in the Accounts Receivable or Accounts Payable module
*Generating documents in the Sales Orders module

Along with billing documents, you can generate inventory documents (such as issues and receipts) in the Inventory module; this requires additional configuration of the Route Management module. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CNF_Overview_Route|Configuring Route Management].{br}

The documents are further processed in the respective modules and financial transactions are posted to the General Ledger module. In the following figure, you can see the flow of documents from the Route Management module.[anchor|#_367e0cb3-a122-4b96-95df-21e788767340][anchor|#_9a5feb82-4ea0-4330-8297-8b9223c62b2f][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Document_Flow_RM.png|popup|Document flow from Route Management|450px]
==Managing Staff Members (Drivers)==
The integration of the Route Management module with the Service Management module gives you the ability to define drivers in the system in order to track and assign them to routes. A driver is staff member that can perform services related to routes. You can quickly and easily select the most appropriate available person to deliver your services. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Drivers|Managing Drivers].
==Managing Vehicles==
You can enter and store information about each vehicle of your company. Because the Route Management module is integrated with the Equipment Management module, each vehicle can be also tracked there. In the Route Management module, you can quickly select a vehicle to execute a route from all available vehicles. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Vehicles|Managing Vehicles].
==Managing Inventory Items==
With the integration between the Route Management module and the Inventory module, you can register the items that are transferred to or from warehouses while route services are performed. For each route execution that you process in the system, you can generate inventory documents that account for transactions that result in changing inventory quantities and costs. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Inventory_Items|Managing Inventory Items].
==Managing and Processing Routes==
 Acumatica ERP provides tools that make it possible to create and process routes quickly as well as optimize them to minimize gas consumption and travel time. With Bing Maps integrated into the Route Management module, the system calculates the distances and time of the executed route. If you rearrange the order of the appointments in the route to be executed, Bing Maps plots and calculates the route again. You can easily track executed routes and their appointments for particular days and staff members that execute routes by using Bing Maps. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Routes|Managing Routes].
==Processing Route Service Contracts==
With the Route Management module, you can ease the processing of repeat customers&rsquo; appointments that require route planning. You can create schedules when the services need to be performed, and based on these schedules, the system can generate the routes to be executed, with appointments automatically assigned to them. This reduces time and errors when users are entering the necessary routes into the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Processing_Service_Contracts|Processing Route Service Contracts].]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Overview of Route Management Processes You use the Route Management module to plan and manage your organization's routes and the         route services (that is, the services provided when each route is executed), along with         processing the contracts related to the routes. In the system, you create the general         routes, and for each particular execution of the route, you create route executions. Each         stop in the route execution is a route appointment—that is, an appointment with a         service order type of the  Route  behavior. Each route execution is based on a         particular route and inherits some of its settings.  You can track your executed routes by using Bing maps and get the statistics on each         execution of a route, such as the distance and the time needed to execute the route. With         the integration between the Route Management module and the Service Management module of  Acumatica ERP, you can create appointments related to route executions and generate invoices for         services that have been provided.  You use the forms of the Route Management module to perform a variety of procedures related         to processing routes and related documents and entities. These procedures are briefly         described in the following sections of this topic. Integrating the Route Management Module with Other Modules Each route execution created or generated in the Route Management module has appointments         (which are related to service orders) that have been created in the Service Management         module. After the appointments and the route execution are completed or closed, you can         generate billing documents in the appropriate module, depending on the settings of the         Service Management module. The following options are available: Generating documents in the Accounts Receivable or Accounts Payable module Generating documents in the Sales Orders module Along with billing documents, you can generate inventory documents (such as issues and         receipts) in the Inventory module; this requires additional configuration of the Route         Management module. For details, see  Configuring Route Management. The documents are further processed in the respective modules and  financial transactions         are posted to the General Ledger module. In the following figure, you can see the flow of         documents from the Route Management module. Document flow from Route Management Managing Staff Members (Drivers) The integration of the Route Management module with the Service Management module gives you         the ability to define drivers in the system in order to track and assign them to routes. A         driver is staff member that can perform services related to routes. You can quickly and         easily select the most appropriate available person to deliver your services. For details,         see  Managing Drivers. Managing Vehicles You can enter and store information about each vehicle of your company. Because the Route         Management module is integrated with the Equipment Management module, each vehicle can be         also tracked there. In the Route Management module, you can quickly select a vehicle to         execute a route from all available vehicles. For details, see  Managing Vehicles. Managing Inventory Items With the integration between the Route Management module and the Inventory module, you can         register the items that are transferred to or from warehouses while route services are         performed. For each route execution that you process in the system, you can generate         inventory documents that account for transactions that result in changing inventory         quantities and costs. For details, see  Managing Inventory Items. Managing and Processing Routes  Acumatica ERP provides tools that make it possible to create and process routes quickly as well as         optimize them to minimize gas consumption and travel time. With Bing Maps integrated into         the Route Management module, the system calculates the distances and time of the executed         route. If you rearrange the order of the appointments in the route to be executed, Bing         Maps plots and calculates the route again. You can easily track executed routes and their         appointments for particular days and staff members that execute routes by using Bing Maps.         For details, see  Managing Routes. Processing Route Service Contracts With the Route Management module, you can ease the processing of repeat customers'         appointments that require route planning. You can create schedules when the services need to         be performed, and based on these schedules, the system can generate the routes to be         executed, with appointments automatically assigned to them.

This topic describes the process of implementing the Route Management module in Acumatica ERP. In this topic, you will read about the preparation stage and the actual implementation of the Route Management module. {br}{TOC}
==Prerequisites and Dependencies==
Note the following information about steps you must perform before you implement and configure the Route Management module:[anchor|#_009215d4-54cf-42f7-b651-d6f984f5fbe0]
#Your organization&rsquo;s license for Acumatica ERP should include the ''Route Management'' feature and the appropriate ''Vehicles Pack''. The feature should be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Managing_Features|Managing Features].
#The initial system configuration must be completed and the General Ledger module must be configured before you implement the Route Management module. The Service Management module has to be configured before or in conjunction with the Route Management module. Also, the Route Management module can be tightly integrated with the Inventory module. The Inventory module does not require any changes to its configuration when the Route Management module is implemented.

==Preparation==
This section covers the preparation steps you need to perform before you begin the basic configuration of the Route Management module. {br}

The preparation for the basic configuration of the Route Management module should be performed along with the preparation of the Service Management module, as described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CNF_Prep|Prerequisites and Preparation]. You should also do the following preparatory steps:[anchor|#_0e918a25-51cf-4773-b139-1c816399b5c2]
*'''Define autonumbering sequences''': Develop the numbering rules (which will later determine how the autonumbering sequences are configured) for route executions.
*'''Decide whether the inventory has to be updated''': For the service order types with the ''Route'' behavior, decide whether the inventory has to be updated when stock items are picked up or delivered while the services are performed.

==Initial Configuration in the Service Management Module==
The configuration steps for the Service Management module are described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CNF_Flow|Configuration Flow]. Because you are also configuring the Route Management module, in Step 6 (configure Service Management preferences), you have to also define the Bing Maps API key, which you specify in the '''Bing Map API Key''' box of the '''General Settings''' tab in the '''Calendar Board Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]). For instructions on how to get the key, see [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642|Getting a Bing Maps Key].[anchor|#_af0a5e3e-847e-4b3a-b58d-af14a02ba5e9]
==Initial Configuration in the Route Management Module==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_04_00|Route Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100400|FS100400]) form, you have to define the numbering sequence that will be used to generate numbers for new route executions; configure the numbering sequence on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form and select the numbering sequence by its ID in the '''Route Numbering Sequence''' box.{br}

For the standardized billing service contracts, in the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section, you have to specify the module in which the invoices are generated. You do one of the following under '''Generate Invoices In''':[anchor|#_85611c6e-0ddd-4201-8948-4c12cfe2f075]
*If you need to generate invoices for service contracts with services only, you select the '''Accounts Receivable''' option button. With this option selected, you can manage receivables and automate customer invoicing and payment collection in the Accounts Receivable module.
*If you need to generate invoices for service contracts with both services and inventory items that were sold to customers along with the services, you select the '''Sales Orders''' option button. With this option selected, you can create shipments if needed and add additional freight costs in the Sales Orders module.
*If you need to generate invoices for service contracts with both services and inventory items that were sold to customers along with the services but you do not need to create shipments and add additional freight costs, you select the '''SO Invoice''' option button.

When you have selected the module, you specify the default settings for it (also in the '''Invoice Generation Settings''' section) to be used in the invoice documents.{br}

To set the system to activate automatically the next period after an invoice is generated for the previous one, you select the '''Activate Upcoming Period on Invoice Generation''' check box.
==Additional Configuration in the Route Management Module==
For faster data entry, you can specify a route service order type that will be selected on the data entry forms in the '''Default Service Order Type''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_04_00|Route Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100400|FS100400]) form.{br}

If your company needs to update inventory when the stock items are transferred, you need to perform the configuration steps described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Configuraton_Inventory|Configuration of the System for Inventory Updates].{br}

You can also do the following optional steps on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_04_00|Route Management Preferences] form: [anchor|#_83c7af9b-2fd2-4dcc-940b-aac5da221dd8]
*To set up the system to calculate statistics on route execution by using Bing Maps API on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) form, you select the '''Calculate Route Statistics Automatically''' check box. If this check box is cleared, to calculate route execution statistics, you will have to click the '''Calculate Route Statistics''' button on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] form.
*To enable the tracking of GPS locations at start and end point of the executed route, you select the '''Track Start and Complete Location of Route''' check box. The GPS locations will be displayed on the '''Location''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] form.
*To set up appointments added manually to a route on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_37_00|Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) form to be first in the route, you select the '''Set Appointments Created Manually as First in Route''' check box. If this check box is cleared, the added appointments are placed last in the route.
*To make possible to specify months in route contract schedules when they are applicable, you select the '''Enable Seasons in Schedule Contracts'''. The system makes the '''Season Settings''' section available on the '''Recurrence''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) forms.

A driver is an employee of your company who has a driving skill assigned and who is responsible for delivering the route services that your company offers to customers. By using the integration between the Service Management module and Route Management module, you can create, manage, and assign drivers.{br}

In this topic, you will read about adding drivers to the system and assigning drivers to routes.{br}{TOC}
==Adding Drivers==
Before you add drivers to the system, you should add to the system the driving skills that apply to the drivers of your company on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_06_00|Skills] ([~/?ScreenId=FS200600|FS200600]) form. You might add just one driving skill if in your company all drivers require the same skill, or you might have multiple driving skills if you need to assign drivers with somewhat different skills to different routes. For details on skills, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_skills|Skills].{br}

If the staff members who will be designated as drivers have not been added to the system, you should add drivers on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_55_00|Staff] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205500|FS205500]) form as follows:[anchor|#_4957ae46-9269-45f4-b930-66c880cb1209]
#Add a staff member of the ''Employee'' type.
#Assign a driving skill to the staff member.
{br}

 For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_Driver|To Add a Driver].{br}

You can also define an existing staff member of the ''Employee'' type as a driver by assigning a driver skill to the staff member on the '''Skills''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form. When you assign a driving skill to the staff member, the system selects the '''Driver''' check box for the staff member on the '''General Info''' tab of the form.[anchor|#_46d39ac9-c09d-4f79-8061-ab2e166af56e]
==Adding Drivers to a Route ==
In the system, you create the general routes, and for each particular execution of the route, you create route executions. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Processing|Route Processing Workflow]. {br}

For each route that you define in the system, you should include the drivers that can possibly execute this route. These drivers will be available for selection when you assign a driver to a route execution on a particular day. {br}

When you define each route in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_37_00|Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) form, you add possible drivers to the particular route on the '''Route Employees'''. For each driver you want to add, you click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and select a driver in the '''Employee ID''' column.{br}

In the '''Priority Preference''' column, you can also specify the priority with which each assigned driver should be selected to perform services for the route. For example, if one driver has performed the services of this route and knows it well, he or she might have higher priority than a driver who is new and is not familiar with the route or who has served a different geographical area.{br}

The lower the digit you specify in this column, the higher the priority for a driver to be selected for a route service. When you later select drivers for a particular execution of this route, the drivers are listed according to the priority specified for them for this route. If the drivers have the same priority, they are listed according their reference number in the system.((({S:Hint}If you do not assign any drivers to a route, you will not be able to select a driver when you create a route execution based on this route.
)))[anchor|#_09d0d223-82ee-401a-8e1e-ecb49752a4df]
==Assigning Drivers to Execute a Route==
For each route execution defined in the system, you should select at least one driver as follows:[anchor|#_4da146a6-b148-4beb-9a1c-2e86ec5b326c]
*To assign a driver to a particular execution of a route, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Drivers A driver is an employee of your company who has a driving skill assigned and who is         responsible for delivering the route services that your company offers to customers. By         using the integration between the Service Management module and Route Management module, you         can create, manage, and assign drivers. In this topic, you will read about adding drivers to the system and assigning drivers to         routes. Adding Drivers Before you add drivers to the system, you should add to the system the driving skills that         apply to the drivers of your company on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS200600|FS200600]) Skills (FS200600)         form. You might add just one driving skill if in your company all drivers require the same         skill, or you might have multiple driving skills if you need to assign drivers with somewhat         different skills to different routes. For details on skills, see  Skills. If the staff members who will be designated as drivers have not been added to the system, you         should add drivers on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205500|FS205500]) Staff (FS205500) form as follows: Add a staff member of the  Employee  type. Assign a driving skill to the staff member.  For details, see  To Add a Driver. You can also define an existing staff member of the  Employee  type as a driver by         assigning a driver skill to the staff member on the  Skills  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) Employees (EP203000) form. When you assign a driving skill to the         staff member, the system selects the  Driver  check box for the staff         member on the  General Info  tab of the form. Adding Drivers to a Route  In the system, you create the general routes, and for each particular execution of                 the route, you create route executions. For details, see  Route Processing Workflow.                  For each route that you define in the system, you should include the drivers that can                 possibly execute this route. These drivers will be available for selection when you                 assign a driver to a route execution on a particular day.  When you define each route in the system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) Routes (FS203700) form, you add possible                 drivers to the particular route on the  Route Employees . For                 each driver you want to add, you click  Add Row  on the table                 toolbar and select a driver in the  Employee ID  column. In the  Priority Preference  column, you can also specify the                 priority with which each assigned driver should be selected to perform services for                 the route. For example, if one driver has performed the services of this route and                 knows it well, he or she might have higher priority than a driver who is new and is                 not familiar with the route or who has served a different geographical area. The lower the digit you specify in this column, the higher the priority for a driver                 to be selected for a route service. When you later select drivers for a particular                 execution of this route, the drivers are listed according to the priority specified                 for them for this route. If the drivers have the same priority, they are listed                 according their reference number in the system. If you do not assign any drivers to a route, you will not be able to select a                 driver when you create a route execution based on this route. Assigning Drivers to Execute a Route For each route execution defined in the system, you should select at least one driver as           follows: To assign a driver to a particular execution of a route, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details (FS304000) form. On this form, you enter or select the             route execution to which you want to assign the driver, and you click the                Driver Selector  button. You then select the driver in the                Driver Selector  dialog box, which opens. Alternatively,               you can select a driver by clicking the magnifier icon in the                  Driver  box and selecting the driver in the                  Driver  lookup table. To assign drivers to multiple route executions for a specific date range, you use the                 ([~/?ScreenId=FS403900|FS403900]) Route Document Worksheets (FS403900) form. On this form, for each route to             which you want to assign a driver, you click the line with the needed route and then             click  Assign Driver  on the table toolbar. You then select the             driver in the  Driver Selector  dialog box, which               opens. Alternatively, you can select a driver by clicking the magnifier icon in               the  Driver  column and selecting the driver in the                  Driver  lookup table. In the  Driver Selector  dialog box, you select the driver to execute         the route from the list of available drivers. This list contains the drivers that have been         specified for the route on the  Route Employees  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) Routes (FS203700) form and have not yet been assigned to any route         on the day of the route execution. To select a particular driver, you click the line with         the needed driver in the table, and click  Select Driver .  If it is necessary for two drivers to perform the route service, you can assign an         additional driver as follows: To assign an additional driver to a particular route execution on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details form, you select the driver in the  Additional               Driver  box. To assign additional drivers to multiple route executions that are listed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS403900|FS403900]) Route Document Worksheets form, you select the additional driver for each needed route             execution in the  Additional Driver  column. For instructions, see  To Assign Drivers to Execute Routes.  ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS205500|FS205500])  ([~/?ScreenId=FS301000|FS301000]) ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, you can enter information about all your company&rsquo;s vehicles.{br}

In this topic, you will read about adding vehicle types in the system and entering the details of all vehicles.{br}{TOC}
==Adding Vehicle Types==
Vehicle types are used to group vehicles with the same properties. When you add a vehicle type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_42_00|Vehicle Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS204200|FS204200]) form, you specify the identifier and a description of the type. On the '''Attributes''' tab, you can also specify any number of attributes that you want to track for the vehicles of the type. For attributes to be added on this tab, they must be defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form. {br}

When you create a vehicle and assign a vehicle type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_36_00|Vehicles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203600|FS203600]) form, the system fills in the '''Attributes''' tab on this form with the attributes that have been specified for the vehicle type (and any default values you have specified for the attributes). {br}

For instructions on creating a vehicle type, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_Vehicle_Type|To Add a Vehicle Type].
==Entering a Vehicle==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_36_00|Vehicles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203600|FS203600]) form to enter into the system the details about a particular vehicle of your company. For each vehicle you add, you have to specify the type of the vehicle in the '''Vehicle Type ID''' box and the branch location where the vehicle is located in the '''Branch Location''' box.{br}

If attributes are specified for the vehicle type, you can specify or modify the values of these attributes on the '''Attributes''' tab of the form. Values must be specified for each attribute for which the '''Required''' check box is selected.{br}

If the vehicle you&rsquo;re entering has already been entered as a fixed asset in the system, you can associate the fixed asset with the vehicle. To do this, you select the identifier of the necessary fixed asset in the '''Fixed Asset''' box. If the serial number (that is, the vehicle identification number or VIN) and purchase information has been specified for the vehicle on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FA_30_30_00|Fixed Assets] ([~/?ScreenId=FA303000|FA303000]) form, the system fills this information on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_36_00|Vehicles] form. For details on fixed assets, see [HelpRoot_Financials\FA__con_Fixed_Asset_Creation|Fixed Asset Entry].{br}

When you save the vehicle information you have entered, the system creates an equipment entity that corresponds to the vehicle on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_50_00|Equipment] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205000|FS205000]) form. For this equipment, the system selects the '''Vehicle''' check box on this form. In the '''Equipment Nbr.''' box, the system assigns an identifier to the equipment based on the numbering sequence specified in the '''Equipment Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form. The system copies this number into the '''Vehicle ID''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_36_00|Vehicles] form when you save a new vehicle. For details on equipment, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__MNG_Equipment_chapter|Managing Equipment].
==Specifying Identification Numbers and General Information for a Vehicle==
In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_36_00|Vehicles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203600|FS203600]) form, you can specify the license plate number of a vehicle in the '''License Nbr.''' box and the vehicle identification number in the '''VIN''' box.{br}

On the '''General Info''' tab of the form, you can specify the following information:[anchor|#_dfc70676-7573-448a-ba23-290f727bf89c]
*The date when the vehicle was registered in your company in the '''Registered Date''' box
*The identification number marked on the engine of the vehicle in the '''Engine Nbr.''' box
*The number of axles of the vehicle in the '''Axles''' box
*The maximum number of miles per hour for the vehicle in the '''Max. Miles''' box
*The unladen weight of the vehicle in the '''Tare Weight''' box
*The maximum weight at which a vehicle can be operated in the '''Gross Vehicle Weight''' box
*The color of the vehicle in the '''Color ID''' box

==Specifying Purchase Information==
You can specify the following information related to purchasing the vehicle on the '''Purchase Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_36_00|Vehicles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203600|FS203600]) form:[anchor|#_1655ada2-ee2f-48f0-ab6b-7055dd1ca8cf]
*The way the vehicle was acquired ('''Property Type''')
*The vendor that sold or rented the vehicle ('''Vendor''')
*The date of the purchase ('''Purchase Date''')
*The purchase order number ('''Purchase PO Number''')
*The adquisition cost of the vehicle ('''Purchase Amount''')
((({S:Hint}If you select a fixed asset in the '''Fixed Asset''' box for which the purchase information has been specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FA_30_30_00|Fixed Assets] ([~/?ScreenId=FA303000|FA303000]) form, the system fills in the boxes of the '''Purchase Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_36_00|Vehicles] form automatically.

Before you start processing service orders that involve moving inventory items from and to warehouses, you need to configure the system and the services to make the applicable updates to the Inventory module.{br}

In this topic, you will read about this configuration.
==Configuring Inventory==
To be able to register transferred inventory items in the Inventory module, you have to perform the following steps: [anchor|#_03e28a67-5b85-4a27-bdbe-052e78788071]
#For each service order type that is used for route appointments, you select the '''Post Pickup/Delivery Items to Inventory''' check box on the '''Preferences''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form.
#You define at least one item class as a route service class by selecting the '''Route Service Class''' check box on the '''Service Management''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.
#You assign the route service classes to each service for which items are picked up or delivered in the '''Item Class''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.
#For each route service for which items are picked up or delivered, do one of the following:
#*If the items are delivered to the customer, on the '''Pickup/Delivery Item''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form, you select ''Items Will Be Delivered'' in the '''Pickup/Delivery Items''' box and add each inventory item to the table by clicking '''Add Row''' and selecting the item.
#*If the items are picked up from the customer, on the '''Pickup/Delivery Item''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form, you select ''Items Will Be Picked Up'' in the '''Pickup/Delivery Items''' box and add each inventory item to the table by clicking '''Add Row''' and selecting the item.
#You ensure that the items you plan to deliver are available in the needed quantities in a warehouse by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_10_00|Inventory Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) form.
#You ensure that the '''Validate Document Totals on Entry''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.

Now you can use the Route Management module to register the items to be picked up and delivered, which causes updates to the Inventory module.

Configuring Inventory To be able to register transferred inventory items in the Inventory module, you have to         perform the following steps:  For each service order type that is used for route appointments, you select the              Post Pickup/Delivery Items to Inventory  check box on the              Preferences  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types           (FS202300) form. You define at least one item class as a route service class by selecting the              Route Service Class  check box on the  Service             Management  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. You assign the route service classes to each service for which items are picked up or           delivered in the  Item Class  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (FS202000) form. For each route service for which items are picked up or delivered, do one of the             following: If the items are delivered to the customer, on the  Pickup/Delivery                 Item  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form, you select                  Items Will Be Delivered  in the  Pickup/Delivery Items                box and add each inventory item to the table by clicking  Add                 Row  and selecting the item. If the items are picked up from the customer, on the  Pickup/Delivery                 Item  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items form, you select                  Items Will Be Picked Up  in the  Pickup/Delivery Items                box and add each inventory item to the table by clicking  Add                 Row  and selecting the item. You ensure that the items you plan to deliver are available in the needed quantities in           a warehouse by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) Inventory Summary (IN401000) form. You ensure that the  Validate Document Totals on Entry  check box           is cleared on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. Now you can use the Route Management module to register the items to be picked up and         delivered, which causes updates to the Inventory module.

In the Route Management module, you can track inventory items if they are involved in route services and generate the appropriate inventory documents in Acumatica ERP for these items. Inventory items are involved in route services if during the execution of a route, the items are either picked up from the warehouse and delivered to the customer or picked up from the customer and delivered to the warehouse.{br}

{br}

In this chapter, you will read about specifying the inventory items that are picked up or delivered during route execution and generating the corresponding inventory documents in the Route Management module.{br}{TOC}
==Specifying the Inventory Items that Are Picked Up or Delivered==
To be able to reflect in inventory the movement of the items during an appointment, you have to specify the items on the '''Pickup/Delivery Items''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form for the appointment. On this tab, you add a line for each the item that was picked up or delivered, and specify the quantity of the item and the warehouse to or from which the item was moved. The information specified on this tab is used when inventory documents are generated in the system.((({S:Hint}To be able to select an item for the service, an appropriate setting for the service, which is defined in the system as a non-stock item, has to be specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. For details, see Step 2 in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Configuraton_Inventory|Configuration of the System for Inventory Updates].
)))
==Generating Inventory Documents==
You can generate the following inventory documents:[anchor|#_180fa657-a29d-4c2d-b2aa-683079977ecc]
*If items have been delivered to the customer from the warehouse, an inventory document of the ''Issue'' type 
*If items have been picked up from the customer and delivered to the warehouse, an inventory document of the ''Receipt'' type 
{br}

You generate these inventory documents on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_05_00|Inventory Updates] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500500|FS500500]) form. On this form, to display the inventory items for which you want to generate documents, you specify the date of document creation, select all the listed inventory items for which you want to generate documents, and then generate the documents. For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Update_Inventory|To Generate Inventory Documents].{br}

When you invoke the generation process, the system creates the applicable documents with the ''Open'' status in the Inventory module and creates a batch with the generated documents in the Route Management module. The system assigns the batch a reference number in accordance with the numbering sequence assigned to batches in the '''Posting Batch Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form.
==Viewing the Generated Documents==
To view information on the batch in the Route Management module, you click the batch number in the '''Batch Nbr.''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_05_00|Inventory Updates] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500500|FS500500]) form. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_59_00|Inventory Update Batches] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305900|FS305900]) form with the batch selected. On this form, you can find the following details about the batch: the billing cycle, the invoice date, the posting module, the customer, the branch, and the document, service order, and appointment numbers.{br}

To open a generated document included in the batch you are viewing, in the row with the document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_59_00|Inventory Update Batches] form, you click the document number in the '''Document Nbr.''' column; you can then process the document in the Inventory module.

To Generate Inventory Documents On the  Service  tab, click  Route                         Management . In the left pane, navigate to  Processes Recurring Inventory Updates . Optional: In the  Up to Date  box, select the date up to                     which you want the system to display inventory items in the list. By default,                     the current business date is selected. Optional: In the  Route Nbr.  box, select the route for                     which you want the system to display inventory items in the list at the bottom                     of the form. Optional: In the  Appointment Nbr.  box, select the                     appointment for which you want the system to display inventory items in the list                     at the bottom of the form. In the  Document Date  box, select the date to be used on                     the documents that are generated. By default, the current business date is                         selected in the box, but you can select another date. The                              Document Period  box is filled in automatically,                         based on the invoice date you select. Do one of the following:  To process all listed inventory items, click  Process                                 All  on the form toolbar. To process only the inventory items you select, select the unlabeled                             check box for each appointment you want to process, and on the form                             toolbar, click  Process . ]]></column>

In general, the processing of a route and its executions in the system consists of the following steps:[anchor|#_a532852f-d158-49ab-97ce-93c700014045]
#Creating a route: If a route has not been created yet, a manager creates a route with the common details of the route to be executed. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Definition_Entry|Entry of Routes].
#Creating route service contracts for the customers who require recurrent service appointments to be included in a route (optional): The scheduler creates route service contracts. For each service order associated with the route, the scheduler specifies the customer, the schedule with services to be provided, and other details received from the customer. The scheduler also activates the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Service_Contract|Workflow of Route Service Contracts with As-Performed Billing ] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Service_Contract_Schedule|Route Service Contract Schedules].
#Setting up route sequences for scheduled appointments in contracts (optional): The scheduler checks in what order the customers will be visited when the route is executed, and changes the order if necessary. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Sequence|Route Sequence Definition].
#Generating or creating route executions with appointments: If route service contracts have been created for customers, the scheduler generates appointments in the corresponding route execution in the order that is defined in the route sequence. If route service contracts have not been created, the scheduler creates a route execution manually. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Document_Generation|Generation of Appointments for Route Executions] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Document|Entry of Route Executions].
#Adding details to the route execution: The scheduler assigns drivers and vehicles to the route execution defined in the system. Also, he or she adds, deletes, or changes the details and order of the appointments if necessary. The scheduler can manually add or delete appointments if he or she received customers&rsquo; reactive calls. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Drivers|Drivers], [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Assigning_Vehicles|Assignment of Vehicles to Route Executions], and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Routes_Modification|Modification of Route Executions].
#Starting to perform route services: On the day of the route execution, the driver finds in the system the route execution that he or she is assigned to, checks the details, goes to the start location, and starts executing the route. For details, see the [[#_94aca3a9-dbde-4124-9e71-cc6429ecdba4|Starting a Route Execution] section.
#Attending the appointments of the route: At each appointment location, the driver starts the appointment, performs services, and adds to the system additional information (such as any items that are picked up or delivered), if necessary. After all the work on the appointment is done and all information has been entered into the system and checked, the driver completes the appointment in the system. The driver then proceeds to the other appointments that are associated with the route execution and performs them. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Appointment_Processing|Appointment Processing Workflow].
#Completing the execution of the route: After all appointments have been completed, the driver goes to the end location of the route, specifies the end time, and competes the route. For details, see [[#_6ce304dc-42b2-42fe-af88-4f1221008cd0|Completing a Route Execution] section.
#Closing the execution of the route: The accountant verifies information on the route document and its appointments, and closes the route. For details, see the [[#_fa8cf66d-f87f-42df-9913-7ff9f4691ed9|Closing a Route Execution] section.
#Generating billing documents for the customers: An accountant generates billing documents for the completed or closed appointments and processes them in the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Invoices|Generation of Billing Documents from Service Orders] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Invoices_from_Appointments|Generation of Billing Documents from Appointments].

See the illustration of route processing in the following diagram:[anchor|#_84c0873f-3c78-47ff-8b1a-88bf4c9d86e2][anchor|#_4a1f24db-013a-4cbf-914a-6684e9d9bd23][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__Processing_Routes.png|popup|Route processing flow|450px]
In the following sections, you will read about how to perform some of the steps of the route processing.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_94aca3a9-dbde-4124-9e71-cc6429ecdba4]
==Starting a Route Execution==
When a driver is at the start location and ready to execute a route, the driver starts the execution of the route by invoking the '''Start Route''' action and makes any needed changes to the time in the '''Actual Start Time''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Start_Route|To Start a Route Execution]. {br}

Once a route execution is started, it gets the ''In Process'' status. You can complete the route execution after all services have been performed, or you can cancel or reopen the route execution.[anchor|#_6ce304dc-42b2-42fe-af88-4f1221008cd0]
==Completing a Route Execution==
After all appointments related to the route execution have been performed and the driver has arrived at the end location, the driver makes sure all needed information has been entered into the route execution document, checks and changes (if necessary) the end time in the '''Actual End Time''' box, and completes the route execution by invoking the '''End Route''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_07_00|Complete Routes].((({S:Hint}You can also complete a particular route execution or multiple route executions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_07_00|Complete Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500700|FS500700]) form.
)))
Once a route execution is completed, it gets the ''Completed'' status in the system. If any additional service has to be performed or any additional appointment has to take place, you reopen the route execution and complete it after all work is done.[anchor|#_fa8cf66d-f87f-42df-9913-7ff9f4691ed9]
==Closing a Route Execution==
After the employee designated to approve route execution documents in the system has checked the information in the completed route execution, and the appointments of the route execution are ready to be billed, the employee closes the route execution on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_10|Route Closing] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304010|FS304010]) form. Once the route execution document is closed, changes cannot be made to it, and it gets the ''Closed'' status. For details on how to close a route execution, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Close_Routes|To Close Route Executions].((({S:Hint}You can also close a particular route execution or multiple route executions on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_08_00|Close Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500800|FS500800]) form.
)))
If you realize that some information is missing for the route execution, you can unclose it.
==Canceling a Route Execution==
If a route execution is not going to be performed, you can cancel the route execution document (if it has the ''Open'' or ''In Progress'' status) in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) form. Once you cancel a route execution, it is assigned the ''Canceled'' status. For details on how to cancel a route execution, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Cancel_Route|To Cancel a Route Execution]. If it is later determined that the canceled route execution will take place, you can reopen it.
==Reopening a Route Execution==
In the system, if you accidentally have started a route execution or completed a route execution that is not completed yet, or if a canceled route execution is going to take place, you can reopen a route execution document of the ''In Process'', ''Completed'', or ''Canceled'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) form. Once you reopen a route execution document, it gets the ''Open'' status, its information can be edited, and it can be further processed in the system. For details on how to reopen an route, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Reopen_Route|To Reopen a Route Execution].
==Unclosing a Route Execution==
If you have already closed a route execution document and now you need to change any information in it, you can unclose the route on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_10|Route Closing] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304010|FS304010]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) form. Once you unclose a route execution, it gets the ''Completed'' status, and its information can be edited. For details on how to unclose a route execution, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Unclose_Route|To Unclose a Route Execution].

For details, see  Entry of Routes. Creating route service contracts for the customers who require recurrent service           appointments to be included in a route (optional): The scheduler creates route service           contracts. For each service order associated with the route, the scheduler specifies the           customer, the schedule with services to be provided, and other details received from the           customer. The scheduler also activates the contract. For details, see  Workflow of Route Service Contracts with As-Performed Billing  and  Route Service Contract Schedules. Setting up route sequences for scheduled appointments in contracts (optional): The           scheduler checks in what order the customers will be visited when the route is executed,           and changes the order if necessary. For details, see  Route Sequence Definition. Generating or creating route executions with appointments: If route service contracts           have been created for customers, the scheduler generates appointments in the corresponding           route execution in the order that is defined in the route sequence. If route service           contracts have not been created, the scheduler creates a route execution manually. For           details, see  Generation of Appointments for Route Executions and  Entry of Route Executions. Adding details to the route execution: The scheduler assigns drivers and vehicles to the           route execution defined in the system. Also, he or she adds, deletes, or changes the           details and order of the appointments if necessary. The scheduler can manually add or           delete appointments if he or she received customers' reactive calls. For details, see              Drivers,  Assignment of Vehicles to Route Executions, and              Modification of Route Executions. Starting to perform route services: On the day of the route execution, the driver finds           in the system the route execution that he or she is assigned to, checks the details, goes           to the start location, and starts executing the route. For details, see the  Starting a Route Execution Starting a Route Execution section. Attending the appointments of the route: At each appointment location, the driver starts           the appointment, performs services, and adds to the system additional information (such as           any items that are picked up or delivered), if necessary. After all the work on the           appointment is done and all information has been entered into the system and checked, the           driver completes the appointment in the system. The driver then proceeds to the other           appointments that are associated with the route execution and performs them. For details,           see  Appointment Processing Workflow. Completing the execution of the route: After all appointments have been completed, the           driver goes to the end location of the route, specifies the end time, and competes the           route. For details, see  Completing a Route Execution Completing a Route Execution section. Closing the execution of the route: The accountant verifies information on the route           document and its appointments, and closes the route. For details, see the  Closing a Route Execution Closing a Route Execution section. Generating billing documents for the customers: An accountant generates billing           documents for the completed or closed appointments and processes them in the system. For           details, see  Generation of Billing Documents from Service Orders and  Generation of Billing Documents from Appointments. See the illustration of route processing in the following diagram: Route processing flow In the following sections, you will read about how to perform some of the steps of the         route processing. Starting a Route Execution When a driver is at the start location and ready to execute a route, the driver starts the         execution of the route by invoking the  Start Route  action and makes         any needed changes to the time in the  Actual Start Time  box on the             ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details (FS304000) form. For details, see  To Start a Route Execution.  Once a route execution is started, it gets the  In Process  status. You can complete         the route execution after all services have been performed, or you can cancel or reopen the         route execution. Completing a Route Execution After all appointments related to the route execution have been performed and the driver         has arrived at the end location, the driver makes sure all needed information has been         entered into the route execution document, checks and changes (if necessary) the end time in         the  Actual End Time  box, and completes the route execution by         invoking the  End Route  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details         (FS304000) form. For details, see   ([~/?ScreenId=FS500700|FS500700]) Complete Routes. You can also complete a particular route execution or multiple route executions on the             ([~/?ScreenId=FS500700|FS500700]) Complete Routes (FS500700) form. Once a route execution is completed, it gets the  Completed  status in the system. If         any additional service has to be performed or any additional appointment has to take place,         you reopen the route execution and complete it after all work is done. Closing a Route Execution After the employee designated to approve route execution documents in the system has         checked the information in the completed route execution, and the appointments of the route         execution are ready to be billed, the employee closes the route execution on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304010|FS304010]) Route Closing (FS304010) form. Once the route execution document is closed,         changes cannot be made to it, and it gets the  Closed  status. For details on how to         close a route execution, see  To Close Route Executions. You can also close a particular route execution or multiple route executions on the             ([~/?ScreenId=FS500800|FS500800]) Close Routes (FS500800) form. If you realize that some information is missing for the route execution, you can unclose         it. Canceling a Route Execution If a route execution is not going to be performed, you can cancel the route execution         document (if it has the  Open  or  In Progress  status) in the system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details (FS304000) form. Once you cancel a route execution, it is         assigned the  Canceled  status. For details on how to cancel a route execution, see            To Cancel a Route Execution. If it is later determined that the canceled         route execution will take place, you can reopen it. Reopening a Route Execution In the system, if you accidentally have started a route execution or completed a route         execution that is not completed yet, or if a canceled route execution is going to take         place, you can reopen a route execution document of the  In Process ,  Completed ,         or  Canceled  status on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details (FS304000) form. Once         you reopen a route execution document, it gets the  Open  status, its information can         be edited, and it can be further processed in the system. For details on how to reopen an         route, see  To Reopen a Route Execution. Unclosing a Route Execution If you have already closed a route execution document and now you need to change any         information in it, you can unclose the route on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304010|FS304010]) Route Closing         (FS304010) or   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details (FS304000) form. Once you unclose a         route execution, it gets the  Completed  status, and its information can be edited.

In the system, you define each route on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_37_00|Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) form. The route defined on this form contains information that is generally common for multiple route executions performed by your company—that is, the starting and ending locations of the route, the schedule when it can be performed, and the employees (drivers) who can be assigned to execute the route. The route executions are tied to a particular day, a particular driver, a specific vehicle, and particular appointments and services, whereas the route is a template with only particular settings that will be common to the executions of a route. {br}

In this topic, you will read about entering a route into the system and specifying appropriate settings for the route.{br}{TOC}
==Entering a Route ==
You enter a route on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_37_00|Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) form. For the route, you specify an identifier and a description, along with the following information:[anchor|#_2b683f32-b24a-462d-8849-6e804b14b936]
*The starting and ending locations of the route 
*The schedule when the route can be executed
*The drivers who can execute this route and their priority
*Optionally, the attributes of the route

For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Route|To Create a Route ].{br}

After you have created a route in the system, when you create route executions or schedules for the route service contracts and select the route, the system fills in appropriate settings. You can edit routes at any time; the edits will not affect route executions that have already been created based on the route.
==Specifying the Start and End Points of the Route==
The start location of the route is a branch location form where a driver departs to execute a route. You specify the branch and its location in the '''Branch''' and '''Branch Location''' boxes of the '''Start Location''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_37_00|Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) form. {br}

The ending location of the route is a branch location to where a driver arrives when he or she finishes to execute a route. You specify the branch and its location in the '''Branch''' and '''Branch Location''' boxes of the '''End Location''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_37_00|Routes] form.((({S:Hint}Make sure that the addresses have been specified correctly for the branch locations. Otherwise, the system will not be able to calculate the route statistics and show the route on a map.
)))
For each route execution created in the system, the start and end locations are defined by the route specified for the route execution. You cannot change the locations for a particular route.
==Specifying a Schedule==
For the route, you specify the possible schedule when the executions of this route can be performed on the '''Execution Days''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_37_00|Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) form. You define a schedule as follows:[anchor|#_34f9553d-8952-420f-8310-7b7fc1fc43b9]
#You specify the days of week when this route can be executed by selecting the appropriate check boxes.
#For each selected day of week, you specify the time when executions of the route can be started in the '''Start Time''' column.
#You specify the number of executions of this route that can be created per day in the '''Nbr. Trip(s) per Day''' column.
((({S:Hint}Route executions do not necessarily have to be generated or created for all the days specified for the route. But the route executions can be created for ''only ''the days specified for the route associated with the route execution.
)))[anchor|#_d5aa5b9f-8dba-4f77-b7af-3f36c5cb6f8f]
==Adding Drivers to a Route ==
In the system, you create the general routes, and for each particular execution of the route, you create route executions. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Processing|Route Processing Workflow]. {br}

For each route that you define in the system, you should include the drivers that can possibly execute this route. These drivers will be available for selection when you assign a driver to a route execution on a particular day. {br}

When you define each route in the system on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_37_00|Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) form, you add possible drivers to the particular route on the '''Route Employees'''. For each driver you want to add, you click '''Add Row''' on the table toolbar and select a driver in the '''Employee ID''' column.{br}

In the '''Priority Preference''' column, you can also specify the priority with which each assigned driver should be selected to perform services for the route. For example, if one driver has performed the services of this route and knows it well, he or she might have higher priority than a driver who is new and is not familiar with the route or who has served a different geographical area.{br}

The lower the digit you specify in this column, the higher the priority for a driver to be selected for a route service. When you later select drivers for a particular execution of this route, the drivers are listed according to the priority specified for them for this route. If the drivers have the same priority, they are listed according their reference number in the system.((({S:Hint}If you do not assign any drivers to a route, you will not be able to select a driver when you create a route execution based on this route.
)))
==Specifying Attributes for Routes==
An attribute is a site-defined property (for instance, area or problem type) that gives users the ability to specify information for objects in the system beyond the preconfigured settings on the data entry forms. You can specify attributes for the classification of route executions by defining them for a particular route on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_37_00|Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) form. {br}

On this tab, you can select attributes only if they have already been defined in the system. If you need an attribute that has not been defined in the system, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form to create the attribute. Then you will be able to select the new attribute for any route.{br}

The active attributes you specify on this tab will be listed for executions of this route on the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) form. {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_37_00|Routes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) form, you can specify whether each attribute of the route is required. When creating a route execution, the user must specify values for all the required attributes. Also, you can specify default values for any attributes of the route; users can overwrite these values for a particular route execution.{br}

You can deactivate an obsolete attribute for executions of a particular route by clearing the '''Active''' check box. If you do, the deactivated attribute will no longer be displayed for the executions of the route, but all attribute values that have already been specified for existing route executions will still be stored in the database. If you re-activate the attribute, its values (where specified) will become visible in the system again. {br}

However, if it is not necessary to preserve the data related to an obsolete attribute, you can deactivate the attribute and then delete it by using the '''Delete Row''' button on the table toolbar. In this case, the attribute will be permanently deleted from the route and all attribute values will bedeleted from the database.

Make sure that the addresses have been specified correctly for the branch locations.     Otherwise, the system will not be able to calculate the route statistics and show the route on a     map. For each route execution created in the system, the start and end locations are defined by the     route specified for the route execution. You cannot change the locations for a particular     route. Specifying a Schedule For the route, you specify the possible schedule when the executions of this route can be     performed on the  Execution Days  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) Routes (FS203700) form. You define a schedule as follows: You specify the days of week when this route can be executed by selecting the appropriate       check boxes. For each selected day of week, you specify the time when executions of the route can be       started in the  Start Time  column. You specify the number of executions of this route that can be created per day in the         Nbr. Trip(s) per Day  column. Route executions do not necessarily have to be generated or created for all the days     specified for the route. But the route executions can be created for  only  the days     specified for the route associated with the route execution. Adding Drivers to a Route  In the system, you create the general routes, and for each particular execution of                 the route, you create route executions. For details, see  Route Processing Workflow.                  For each route that you define in the system, you should include the drivers that can                 possibly execute this route.

When you define each route in the system on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) Routes (FS203700) form, you add possible                 drivers to the particular route on the  Route Employees . For                 each driver you want to add, you click  Add Row  on the table                 toolbar and select a driver in the  Employee ID  column. In the  Priority Preference  column, you can also specify the                 priority with which each assigned driver should be selected to perform services for                 the route. For example, if one driver has performed the services of this route and                 knows it well, he or she might have higher priority than a driver who is new and is                 not familiar with the route or who has served a different geographical area.

To process the routes that are executed by your company, you have to create route execution documents in the system for each specific day when the route services are provided. You can create route executions in one of the following ways:[anchor|#_642e7cd5-2cad-4ab2-9fbf-078ee7c40593]
*If your company regularly performs route services for a customer on a contract basis, you enter a route service contract and set it up so that routes can be generated. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Service_Contract|Workflow of Route Service Contracts with As-Performed Billing ] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Document_Generation|Generation of Appointments for Route Executions].
*If your company performs services for the customer rarely or you have no contract that defines the details of the services provided, you can create route execution documents manually.

In this topic, you will read about how to enter a route execution manually.
==Entering a Route Execution Manually==
You enter a route execution on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) form. For the route execution, you specify the following information:[anchor|#_a8f70946-f506-4e79-850b-b0bbcc72c97b]
*The route to which the route execution relates. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Definition_Entry|Entry of Routes].
*The date of the route execution. You can select a date that is one of the days of the week specified for the associated route.
*The driver or drivers who will perform the services of the route execution. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Drivers#_09d0d223-82ee-401a-8e1e-ecb49752a4df|Assigning Drivers to Execute a Route].
*The vehicle or vehicles to be used for the route execution. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Assigning_Vehicles|Assignment of Vehicles to Route Executions].
*The values of the attributes defined for executions of the route. You can specify or modify the values of any attributes that are listed on the '''Attributes''' tab; if the '''Required''' check box is selected for an attribute, you must specify a value for it.

After you have specified and saved this information, you can create and add appointments for the route execution by clicking '''Create New Appointment''' on the table toolbar and filling in information about each appointment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Appointments|Appointment Creation].((({S:Hint}You can assign to appointments on the route only services that are indicated as route services in the system (that is, they have the '''Route Service''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_40_08_00|Services] ([~/?ScreenId=FS400800|FS400800]) form). These services have to be assigned to the route service class (that, is the '''Route Service Class''' is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form). For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Route_Service_Class|To Create a Route Service Class] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Route_Service|To Create a Route Service].
)))
By default, the system assigns a new route execution document the ''Open'' status. Reference numbers for new route execution documents are generated according to the numbering sequence specified in the '''Route Numbering Sequence''' box on the '''Routes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form.{br}

You can now process the route execution. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Processing|Route Processing Workflow].
==Viewing Route Statistics==
The route execution statistics contain information about the number of appointments and services related to the executed route, the duration of activities related to it, and the total distance traveled. In the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) form ('''Route Statistics''' section), you can view the route statistics for the selected route execution. {br}

The statistics can be calculated automatically by the system or the process of calculation can be invoked manually. If the '''Calculate Route Statistics Automatically''' check box is selected on the '''Routes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form, the system will automatically update the '''Route Statistics''' section if you make changes in the route execution.{br}

If the '''Calculate Route Statistics Automatically''' check box is cleared, you have to click the '''Calculate Route Statistics''' button on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_40_00|Route Document Details] form to recalculate statistics in the '''Route Statistics''' section.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Entry of Route Executions To process the routes that are executed by your company, you have to create route execution         documents in the system for each specific day when the route services are provided. You can         create route executions in one of the following ways: If your company regularly performs route services for a customer on a contract basis,           you enter a route service contract and set it up so that routes can be generated. For           details, see  Workflow of Route Service Contracts with As-Performed Billing  and  Generation of Appointments for Route Executions. If your company performs services for the customer rarely or you have no contract that           defines the details of the services provided, you can create route execution documents           manually. In this topic, you will read about how to enter a route execution manually. Entering a Route Execution Manually You enter a route execution on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details (FS304000) form. For         the route execution, you specify the following information: The route to which the route execution relates. For details, see  Entry of Routes. The date of the route execution. You can select a date that is one of the days of the           week specified for the associated route. The driver or drivers who will perform the services of the route execution. For details,           see  Assigning Drivers to Execute a Route. The vehicle or vehicles to be used for the route execution. For details, see  Assignment of Vehicles to Route Executions. The values of the attributes defined for executions of the route. You can specify or           modify the values of any attributes that are listed on the              Attributes  tab; if the  Required  check box           is selected for an attribute, you must specify a value for it. After you have specified and saved this information, you can create and add appointments         for the route execution by clicking  Create New Appointment  on the         table toolbar and filling in information about each appointment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200)         form.          For details, see  Appointment Creation. You can assign to appointments on the route only services that are indicated as route         services in the system (that is, they have the  Route Service  check         box selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS400800|FS400800]) Services (FS400800) form). These services have         to be assigned to the route service class (that, is the  Route Service           Class  is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form).         For instructions, see  To Create a Route Service Class and  To Create a Route Service. By default, the system assigns a new route execution document the  Open  status.         Reference numbers for new route execution documents are generated according to the numbering         sequence specified in the  Route Numbering Sequence  box on the            Routes  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100)         form. You can now process the route execution. For details, see  Route Processing Workflow. Viewing Route Statistics The route execution statistics contain information about the number of appointments and         services related to the executed route, the duration of activities related to it, and the         total distance traveled. In the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details         (FS304000) form ( Route Statistics  section), you can view the route         statistics for the selected route execution.  The statistics can be calculated automatically by the system or the process of calculation         can be invoked manually. If the  Calculate Route Statistics           Automatically  check box is selected on the  Routes  tab         of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form, the system will automatically         update the  Route Statistics  section if you make changes in the route         execution. If the  Calculate Route Statistics Automatically  check box is         cleared, you have to click the  Calculate Route Statistics  button on         the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details form to recalculate statistics in         the  Route Statistics  section.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Create a Route Service Class A route service class is an item class that defines default settings for services                 that are performed during route executions. You create a route service class for                 routes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes                 (IN201000) form. You open this form as described in the following procedure, or                 navigate directly to this form. For details on general service classes, see  Service Classes in the Field Services Guide. Before You Proceed Before you start creating service classes, make sure that the necessary units of                 measure for route services have been created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100)                 form. If you want to specify different values for the unit conversions, make sure                 that the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                 form. To Create a Route Service Class Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form by searching for or navigating to it. To open any form, you can navigate to it or search             for it (by its name or by its form ID without periods). For more information about             search capabilities, see  Search in the Modern UI. Click  New Record  on the form toolbar. In the  Enter Keys  dialog box, which opens, in the  Value  column, type the identifier to be used for this route service class, and click  Finish . The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form opens. Optional: In the  Description  box, enter a brief description of the route service class. On the  General Settings  tab, in the  General Settings  section, perform the following instructions: Make sure the  Stock Item  check box is cleared.  This defines the item class as being for non-stock items. Make sure that  Service  is selected in the  Item Type  box. Services (specifically route services) are the type of non-stock items this item class will contain. Optional: In the  Tax Category  box, select the tax category to be assigned by default to new services of this class. Optional: In the  Posting Class  box, select the posting class to be assigned by default to new services of this class. Optional: In the  Lot/Serial Class  box, select the lot/serial class you want to be used for services of this class. Optional: In the  Price Class  box, select the price class to be assigned to new items of this service class. Optional: In the  Default Warehouse  box, select the warehouse that is used for receiving and issuing the items of this service class (that is, inventory items that are involved in route services). The selected warehouse will be assigned to new items (services) of this service class by default. In the  Unit of Measure  section, do the following: In the  Base Unit  box, select the unit of measure to be used as the default base unit for services of the service class. In the  Sales Unit  box, select the unit of measure to be used as the default sales unit for services of the service class. In the  Purchase Unit  box, select the unit of measure to be used as the default purchase unit for services of the service class. On the  Service Management  tab, in the  Default Billing Rule  box, do one of the following to select the default billing option for the services of this class: If you want to bill the services based on the time spent on the service, select  Time . If you want to bill the services at a fixed rate, regardless of the time spent on the service, select  Flat Rate . If you do not want to bill the services, select  None . In the  Route Management  area, select the  Route Service Class  check box. Click  Save . Notes About the Procedure The notes in this section describe the nuances of the UI elements available on             the form, such as when an element is required and when it is not, and when the system             fills in settings by default. This section can include other notes. Notes about the  General Settings  tab: The  Lot/Serial Class  box, is available only if the  Lot                         and Serial Tracking  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                     form.  The  Default Warehouse  box is available only if the                          Multiple Warehouses  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form.  If the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form, if a unit                 of measure is selected for any of these three boxes, it will be automatically                 selected for the rest of the boxes. ]]></column>

You can process and track contracts on recurring services that require a route to be performed. A route service contract represents a document that contains information on the predefined services that are going to be performed at the predefined frequency, according to the agreement between the customer and the company.{br}

In Acumatica ERP you can select whether the billing for a service contract is performed after the appointments were attended based on what was done during the appointment (that is, ''as performed'' billing) or the billing is performed based on what is covered by the contract at the end of the billing period (that is, ''standardized billing''). {br}

This chapter describes the general workflow of two types of service contracts, creation, activation, cancellation, and suspension of the contracts in the system, their schedules, service order or appointment generation from contracts, and generation of invoices for standardized billing contracts in Acumatica ERP.

In Acumatica ERP, you can control the steps required to process your company&rsquo;s ''as performed billing'' route service contracts—that is, route service contracts that are billed after the appointments took place based on what was done during the appointment. For these contracts the ''As Performed Billings'' option is selected in the '''Billing Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) form.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the general workflow of processing as performed billing route service contracts and about tracking the history of actions performed for the contract.{br}{TOC}
==Processing Workflow==
In general, when processing a route service contract, your employees perform the following steps:[anchor|#_bbe81767-f37b-4bf3-b5a8-f8e34639dcfe]
#Entering the as performed billing route service contract: The scheduler or service manager enters the route service contract into the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Contract_Entry|Entry of the Route Service Contract].
#Creating schedules: The scheduler creates the schedule (or schedules) for route service delivery for the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Service_Contract_Schedule|Route Service Contract Schedules].
#Activating the as performed billing service contract: The scheduler activates the route service contract in the system so that he or she can generate appointments for the contract schedules. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_RouteServiceContractActivation|Activation of a Route Service Contract].
#Checking and editing (if necessary) the order in which appointments for a contract will be generated in the route execution: This step is described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Sequence|Route Sequence Definition].
#Generating the appointments: The scheduler generates appointments. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Document_Generation|Generation of Appointments for Route Executions].
#:After the appointments have been generated, they are processed, as described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Appointment_Processing|Appointment Processing Workflow].
#Generating and processing invoices for the service orders or appointments: An accountant approves service orders or appointments for generation invoices. He or she then generates invoices for the service orders and appointments and processes them in the system. For details on how to bill the customer for provided services, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Invoices|Generation of Billing Documents from Service Orders] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Invoices_from_Appointments|Generation of Billing Documents from Appointments].
#Suspending the contract (optional): If it is necessary to hold the contract for a while, the scheduler can suspend the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Contract_Suspension|Suspension of a Route Service Contract].
#Canceling the contact (optional): If the scheduler has activated the contract but the services for the contract are not going to be provided for some reason, the scheduler can cancel the contract. This step can be performed after your company started to provide services according to the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Contract_Cancellation|Cancellation of a Route Service Contracts].

The following diagram illustrates the processing of a route service contract with as-performed billing.[anchor|#_46f7f92e-f2fe-47bf-a5d2-5d8fefc72066][anchor|#_0406e406-8d95-43ff-aefd-79be247594f3][image:UserGuide/Images/FS__As_Performed_Route_Service_Contract.png|popup|Processing of a route service contract with as-performed billing|450px][anchor|#_26d26963-5114-436e-8110-45d28f5e9261]
==Route Service Contract History==
For each particular route service contract, you can view a history of actions performed on the contract or its schedules on the '''Contract History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) form.{br}

For the service contract, you can view the date when the action was invoked and the date when the action is applied to the contract. The history of the following contract actions you can view: ''Create'', ''Activate'', ''Suspend'', ''Cancel'', and ''Expire''.{br}

For the schedules of the service contract, you can view the date when the action was invoked, the recurrence description and whether the recurrence has been modified (if the contract has been suspended and activated again). The history of the following schedule actions you can view: ''Create'', ''Inactivate'', and ''Delete''.

In Acumatica ERP, you can control the steps required to process your company&rsquo;s service contracts with the ''standardized billing''—that is, service contracts that are billed at the end of the billing period for the items that have been specified in the contract as well as for overage items. For this contracts the ''Standardized Plus Usage/Overage Billings'' option is selected in the '''Billing Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) form.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the general workflow of processing route service contracts with the standardized billing and about tracking the history of actions performed for the contract.{br}{TOC}
==Processing Workflow==
In general, the processing of a service contract with the standardized billing consists of the following steps:[anchor|#_835b976b-2ad0-41bc-8075-a8f6d1109c1f]
#Entering the route service contract: The scheduler or service manager enters the route service contract with standardized billing into the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Contract_Entry|Entry of the Route Service Contract].
#Creating schedules (optional): The scheduler creates the schedule (or schedules) for route service delivery for the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Service_Contract_Schedule|Route Service Contract Schedules].
#Activating the as performed billing service contract: The scheduler activates the route service contract in the system so that he or she can generate appointments for the contract schedules. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_RouteServiceContractActivation|Activation of a Route Service Contract].
#Checking and editing (if necessary) the order in which appointments for a contract will be generated in the route execution (optional): If schedules are created for the contract, you check and modify the sequence in which customers will be visited. This step is described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Sequence|Route Sequence Definition].
#Generating the appointments: If a related schedule has been created, the scheduler generates appointments. After the appointments have been generated, they are processed. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Document_Generation|Generation of Appointments for Route Executions].
#Creating the appointments on the fly: If a related schedule has not been created or additional appointments are needed, the scheduler creates appointments. The appointments are then processed. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Appointment_Processing|Appointment Processing Workflow].
#Generating and processing billing documents for the standardized billing contract: An accountant approves appointments for generation of billing documents. He or she then generates billing documents for the appointments and processes them in the system. For details on how to bill the customer for provided services, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Contract_Payments|Billing Customers for Route Service Contracts Based on Standardized Billing ].
#Modify the next billing period (optional): If any changes are necessary, the scheduler modifies the next billing period. The scheduler can add or delete services and non-stock items for the next billing period. He or she can also modify the quantity and prices of the existing items.
#Activate the next billing period (optional): If the '''Activate Upcoming Period on Invoice Generation''' check box is not selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_04_00|Route Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100400|FS100400]) form, the schedulers activates the next billing period for the contract. 
#Suspending the contract (optional): If it is necessary to hold the contract for a while, the scheduler can suspend the contract. The contract can then be activated again. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Contract_Suspension|Suspension of a Route Service Contract].
#Canceling the contact (optional): If the scheduler has activated the contract but the services for the contract are not going to be provided for some reason, the scheduler can cancel the contract. This step can be performed before or after your company has started to provide services according to the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Contract_Cancellation|Cancellation of a Route Service Contracts].

==Route Service Contract History==
For each particular route service contract, you can view a history of actions performed on the contract or its schedules on the '''Contract History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) form.{br}

For the service contract, you can view the date when the action was invoked and the date when the action is applied to the contract. The history of the following contract actions you can view: ''Create'', ''Activate'', ''Suspend'', ''Cancel'', and ''Expire''.{br}

For the schedules of the service contract, you can view the date when the action was invoked, the recurrence description and whether the recurrence has been modified (if the contract has been suspended and activated again). The history of the following schedule actions you can view: ''Create'', ''Inactivate'', and ''Delete''.

When you enter a contract, you specify its general information (such as date and customer information), specify the billing type, and assign schedules to the contract. Depending on the billing type, you provide different information on the service contract. When you save the service contract, it is initially assigned the ''Draft'' status; you can then modify the contract details or activate the contract.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the information to be specified when you create route service contracts with as-performed billing and with standardized billing.{br}{TOC}
==General Information to Be Specified in a Service Contract==
When you enter the route service contract on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) form, you specify the following information: [anchor|#_81ee9eec-3696-4aeb-97f5-e9552291550b]
*The customer and its location (if required): You specify these settings in the '''Customer''' and '''Location''' boxes in the Summary area of the form.
*The date information of the route service contract: You specify the start date and end date (if the contract has an expiration date) of the contract in the '''Contract Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab.
*Your company&rsquo;s branch and its location: You specify these settings in the '''Branch''' and '''Branch Location''' boxes of the '''Billing Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab.
*The type of billing to be used for the service contract: You select whether the billing for a service contract is performed after each appointments has been attended based on what was done during the appointment (as-performed billing) or the billing is performed at the end of each billing period based on what is covered by the contract (standardized billing). You specify this setting in the '''Billing Type''' box of the '''Billing Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab.
*The type of the documents to be generated for the service contract: If schedules will be created for the contract, the system displays that appointments will be generated for the schedules in the '''Schedule Generation Type''' box (in the '''Contract Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab). For standardized billing contracts, if schedules will not be created, in the '''Schedule Generation Type''' box, you specify ''None'', indicating that no documents will be generated.
*The customer account to which invoices will be sent: By default, the invoices are sent to the customer account related to the service order but you can change the account in the '''Contract Billing Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab.
*The master contract (optional): You can specify the master contract to which this service contract is related in the '''Master Contract''' box in the Summary area.
*The vendor (optional): If a vendor rather than a staff member delivers services, you can specify the vendor in the '''Vendor''' box in the '''Contract Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab.
*The commission information (optional): If a salesperson is involved, you specify the commission settings in the '''Contract Settings''' section on the '''Summary''' tab.
*The attributes (optional): If additional properties have to be specified for the service contract, you specify or modify the values for the attributes on the '''Attributes''' tab. You have to specify values for the attributes for which the '''Required''' check box is selected. When a new service contract is created, the system populates this tab with the attributes defined for the ''Service Contract'' entity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_20_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000]) form.

==Information to Be Specified in the As-Performed Contract==
For as-performed billing contracts (that is, contracts that have the ''As-Performed Billings'' billing type), you create at least one schedule for the services that need to be performed, and you can then generate appointments for the customer according to the schedule. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Service_Contract_Schedule|Route Service Contract Schedules] and [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Document_Generation|Generation of Appointments for Route Executions].{br}

When the schedules are created for the contract, if the prices specified in the contract should be used (that is, ''Contract'' is selected in the '''Take Prices From''' box of the '''As-Performed Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) form, you have to specify the prices on the '''Service Prices''' and '''Inventory Item Prices''' tabs (if stock items will be sold during the appointments).{br}

For instructions on how to create a route service contract with as-performed billing, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Create_Route_Service_Contract|To Create an As Performed Billing Route Service Contract].
==Information to Be Specified in the Standardized Billing Contract==
For standardized billing contracts (that is, contracts that have the ''Standardized Plus Usage/Overage Billings'' billing type), you have to define the billing period in the '''Period''' box in the '''Standardized Billing Settings''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) form. You can select one of the following options: ''Week'', ''Month'', ''Quarter'', ''Half a Year'', and ''Year''.{br}

On the '''Services per Period''' tab, you add services and non-stock items that are covered during each billing period. For each item, you specify the quantity in the '''Amount''' column and the price that is paid for the specified quantity of items in the '''Recurring Item Price''' column. You also specify the price for the case when the specified quantity has been exceeded during the period in the '''Overage Item Price''' column.{br}

If necessary, you can change the billing rule for each item in the '''Billing Rule''' column of the '''Services per Period''' tab and specify the related target equipment in the '''Target Equipment ID''' column.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you have to activate a route service contract in the system to be able to generate appointments and billing documents for the contract. You can activate a draft of a contract for the first time or activate previously suspended contract. For the activated contracts, you cannot change the billing type and date information of route service contracts. {br}

In this topic, you will read about activation of the draft contracts and suspended contracts.{br}{TOC}
==Activating a Route Service Contract with the Draft Status==
When you create a service contract in the system, the contract is automatically assigned the ''Draft'' status. When you finish entering the necessary information for the contract, you should activate the contract so that you can generate appointments and billing documents for it. {br}

You activate the contract on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) form by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Activate Contract''' on the form toolbar. The system changes the status of the service contract to ''Active''. For the activated contracts, you cannot change the billing type and date information of service contracts.{br}

For detailed instructions on how to activate contracts, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Activate_Route_Contract#_96653242-4b7c-4b47-bccd-c7f680d0999a|To Activate a Route Service Contract with the Draft Status].[anchor|#_ff470669-3512-4570-add7-5229f8ea2b44]
==Activating a Service Contract with the Suspended Status==
Contracts with the ''Suspended'' status can be activated again starting on a particular date (whether or not it is the current date). To activate a suspended service contract, you open the necessary contract on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) form and click '''Actions''' > '''Activate Contract''' on the form toolbar. The system opens the '''Activation Contract''' dialog box, in which you specify the starting date when the contract has to be activated.{br}

If schedules have been generated for the service contract, you can view them in the table of the '''Activation Contract''' dialog box. You can change the date of the appointments to be generated when the contract is active. To do so, for each schedule, you select the check box in the '''Change Recurrence''' column. You then specify the date since which the service orders or appointments will be generated according to the schedule for the active contract in the '''Effective Recurrence Start Date''' column. The system recalculates the '''Next Execution''' date.{br}

If the activation date is later than the current date, when you click '''OK''' to close the dialog box and return to the form, the '''Upcoming Status''' box contains ''Active'' (indicating that the service contract will be active) and the '''Effective Until Date''' box contains the activation date (indicating that the current status of ''Suspended'' is effective until the activation date.{br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can manage the schedules of the route service contracts. A route service contract schedule defines the route service (or services), inventory items, and other settings that the generated appointments of route executions will have, as well as the recurrence of the generation. {br}

In this topic, you will read about creating a schedule and specifying its settings.
==Creating a Route Service Contract Schedule==
You create a new service contract schedule by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) form, which opens when you click '''Add Schedule''' on the table toolbar on the '''Schedules''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) form. (You can also open this form to view or edit an existing schedule by clicking a link in the '''Schedule ID''' column on this tab.) {br}

In the '''Service Order Type''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] form, you select a service order type that has the ''Route'' behavior assigned on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form. This type will be used for the service orders that will be generated according to the schedule. You then specify the other settings of the schedule as follows:[anchor|#_a62ba1f9-3ef6-4a79-a97e-1fdf352429c2]
*The services that are delivered, which you add on the '''Services''' tab
*Any stock items involved in the route services, which you add on the '''Inventory Items''' tab
*The schedule recurrence settings, which are specified on the '''Recurrence''' tab
*The route related to the contract, which is selected on the '''Routes''' tab
*Optionally, the values of the attributes related to the service orders or appointments generated from the schedule, on the '''Attributes''' tab

For details on how to add a schedule, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Add_Route_Schedule|To Add a Route Schedule].{br}

For a route service contract, you can create one schedule or multiple schedules. The system generates the reference numbers for schedules based on the reference number of the related route service contract and the sequence number of the schedule created for this route service contract (''1'' for the first schedule, ''2'' for the second, and so on). For example, if the route service contract has the reference number ''000001'' in the system and you create the first schedule for this route service contract, the reference number of the schedule will be ''000001-1''. You can view the list of schedules that have been created for a particular route service contract on the '''Schedules''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] form.[anchor|#_52d6d59c-7f64-4c98-bad3-b30206db5aad]
==Defining Schedule Settings==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) form, for each schedule, you have to specify the recurrence frequency type and the schedule settings. Frequency type defines how often the schedule appointments can be generated for the schedule.((({S:Hint}The route can be executed only on the days specified in the route related to the contract. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Definition_Entry|Entry of Routes].
)))
On the '''Recurrence''' tab, you can select one of the following option buttons: [anchor|#_b2102836-7066-4978-bd27-387327582e33]
*'''Daily''': The schedule applies daily or every ''x'' days.
*'''Weekly''': The schedule applies weekly or every ''x'' weeks.
*'''Monthly''': The schedule applies monthly or every ''x'' months.
*'''Yearly''': The schedule applies yearly or every ''x'' years.

After you select the frequency type, you have to specify settings for the selected type as follows:[anchor|#ul_nxx_nrf_px]
*If you selected the '''Daily''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in days when the schedule applies. For example, if you specify every 1 day, the schedule applies every day, and if you specify every 2 days,the schedule applies every other day.
*If you selected the '''Weekly''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in weeks and the day or days of the week when the schedule applies. For example, if you specify every 2 weeks and select Monday, the schedule applies Monday of every other week.
*If you selected the '''Monthly''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in months and the day or days of the month when the schedule applies. There are two options for specifying the day: by the number of the day of the month, or by the week of the month and the day of the week. For example, you can specify that the schedule repeats every 2 months on the 2nd day of the month, or on the 2nd Monday of the month. You can specify up to four days for the '''Monthly''' frequency type by selecting and appropriate check box and specifying days in the '''Second Recurrence Monthly Settings''', '''Third Recurrence Monthly Settings''', and '''Fourth Recurrence Monthly Settings''' sections. 
*If you selected the '''Yearly''' frequency type, you have to specify the time interval in years, the month or months of the year, and the day of the month when the schedule applies. There are two options for specifying the day of the month: by the number of the day of the month (for example, every 2 years on the 2nd day of February and March), or by the week of the month and the day of the week (for example, every year on the 2nd Monday of February and March). 
{br}

If the '''Enable Seasons in Schedule Contracts''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form, you can also specify the months when the schedule is applicable for the '''Daily''', '''Weekly''', and '''Monthly''' frequency types in the '''Season Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] form.

(You can also open this form to view or edit an existing schedule by clicking a     link in the  Schedule ID  column on this tab.)  In the  Service Order Type  box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) Route Service Contract Schedules     form, you select a service order type that has the  Route  behavior assigned on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) Service Order Types (FS202300) form. This type will be used for the service orders     that will be generated according to the schedule. You then specify the other settings of the     schedule as follows: The services that are delivered, which you add on the  Services       tab Any stock items involved in the route services, which you add on the  Inventory       Items  tab The schedule recurrence settings, which are specified on the        Recurrence  tab The route related to the contract, which is selected on the  Routes       tab Optionally, the values of the attributes related to the service orders or appointments      generated from the schedule, on the  Attributes  tab For details on how to add a schedule, see  To Add a Route Schedule.

The system     generates the reference numbers for schedules based on the reference number of the related route     service contract and the sequence number of the schedule created for this route service contract      ( 1  for the first schedule,  2  for the second, and so on). For example, if the     route service contract has the reference number  000001  in the system and you create the     first schedule for this route service contract, the reference number of the schedule will be       000001-1 . You can view the list of schedules that have been created for a particular     route service contract on the  Schedules  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) Route Service Contract Schedules form. Defining Schedule Settings On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) Route Service Contract Schedules (FS305600) form, for each schedule, you have to     specify the recurrence frequency type and the schedule settings. Frequency type defines how     often the schedule appointments can be generated for the schedule. The route can be executed only on the days specified in the route related to the contract.     For details, see  Entry of Routes. On the  Recurrence  tab, you can select one of the following option     buttons:  Daily : The schedule applies daily or every  x  days. Weekly : The schedule applies weekly or every  x  weeks. Monthly : The schedule applies monthly or every  x  months. Yearly : The schedule applies yearly or every  x  years. After you select the frequency type, you have to specify settings for the selected type as      follows: If you selected the  Daily  frequency type, you have to specify the       time interval in days when the schedule applies. For example, if you specify every 1 day, the       schedule applies every day, and if you specify every 2 days,the schedule applies every other       day. If you selected the  Weekly  frequency type, you have to specify the       time interval in weeks and the day or days of the week when the schedule applies. For example,       if you specify every 2 weeks and select Monday, the schedule applies Monday of every other       week. If you selected the  Monthly  frequency type, you have to specify the       time interval in months and the day or days of the month when the schedule applies. There are       two options for specifying the day: by the number of the day of the month, or by the week of       the month and the day of the week. For example, you can specify that the schedule repeats       every 2 months on the 2nd day of the month, or on the 2nd Monday of the month. You can specify       up to four days for the  Monthly  frequency type by selecting and       appropriate check box and specifying days in the  Second Recurrence Monthly        Settings ,  Third Recurrence Monthly Settings , and         Fourth Recurrence Monthly Settings  sections.  If you selected the  Yearly  frequency type, you have to specify the       time interval in years, the month or months of the year, and the day of the month when the       schedule applies. There are two options for specifying the day of the month: by the number of       the day of the month (for example, every 2 years on the 2nd day of February and March), or by       the week of the month and the day of the week (for example, every year on the 2nd Monday of       February and March).  If the  Enable Seasons in Schedule Contracts  check box is selected on     the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form, you can also specify the months when the     schedule is applicable for the  Daily ,  Weekly , and       Monthly  frequency types in the  Season Settings      section of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) Route Service Contract Schedules form.

The appointments for different contracts with the same route are generated automatically in one route execution for a specific date. Thus, you may need to define the order of appointments for each route execution.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how to define a route sequence in the system and how to reset the route order numbers of a sequence.[anchor|#_1ba16245-71ba-4a46-9793-51ac5b4237b8]
==Route Sequence Definition==
When you create a schedule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) form, the system assigns the order number to the schedule in the '''Order''' box of the '''Routes''' tab. You can change the order number as follows:[anchor|#_a233690b-2dbd-4814-924e-64714bd95a84]
*You can change the number that defines the order of appointments of a particular route service contract in the '''Order''' box on the '''Routes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] form.
*You can define the sequence in which appointments are generated in a route execution on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_38_00|Route Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS303800|FS303800]) form, which displays the appointments and includes the '''Order''' column. For instructions, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Set_Up_Route_Sequence|To Set Up a Route Sequence].

The number that defines the order of the appointment (that is, the '''Order''' value) can contain up to five digits. To define the sequence, the system uses numbers that go up in increments of 10, such as 00010, 00020, 00030, and so on. You can change the order values to change the order of the appointments. You can use any number, such as 00008 or 00012. After you change the order number, the system changes the order of the appointments as follows: The appointment for a schedule with a lower number takes place earlier than an appointment for a schedule with a higher number.{br}

Based on the sequence settings you specify, a route execution will be built and the route distances and travel time will be calculated. For a particular route execution, you can change the order of appointments manually. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Routes_Modification|Modification of Route Executions].
==Order Number Reset==
You can reset the order numbers to the numbering defined by default by the system (that is, 00010, 00020, 00030, and so on) by clicking '''Reset Sequence''' on the form toolbar. The order of appointments will not be changed (only the numbering sequence). {br}

Consider the following example. Suppose that the order 00010, 00020, and 00030 is set by default as order of the appointments for the schedules of Customer 1, Customer 2, and Customer 3, respectively. You then decide to change the order in which the customers are visited during a route execution; you want Customer 3 to be visited first, and then Customer 1 and Customer 2. To do this, you change the order number of the schedule of Customer 3 to a lower number, such as 00001. Now you have the following order: [anchor|#_11acd9a9-3201-42a7-8be7-a3db84e20e33]
*00001 for the schedules of Customer 3
*00010 for the schedules of Customer 1
*00020 for the schedules of Customer 2

Suppose that you then learn that the new order will not work for one of the customers. To revert to the system-assigned order, click '''Reset Sequence'''. The system updates the order numbers as follows:[anchor|#_fbde7e0f-ac8e-4a7e-84ad-42bdbb7cfad0]
*00010 for the schedules of Customer 3
*00020 for the schedules of Customer 1
*00030 for the schedules of Customer 2

In Acumatica ERP, the final step of processing a route service contract is generating the appointments for route executions. If a route execution for a specific day does not yet exist in the system, the system generates a route execution along with the appointments. If a route execution for a specific day exists in the system, the system generates appointments, and they are included in the existing route execution.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how the appointments of route executions are generated for a route service contract and how the generation process can be canceled in the system.
==Generating Appointments==
You generate the route appointments in the system according to the route service contract schedules you have created. You can generate appointments manually or create an automation schedule to generate the appointments. For more information on automation, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Scheduled_Processing|Scheduled Processing].{br}

To generate schedules manually, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_02_00|Generate Route Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500200|FS500200]) form. You can navigate directly to this form, or you can navigate to this form from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) form by clicking the '''Generate Route Appointments''' button on the form toolbar. (This button becomes available after you have specified the schedule recurrence settings and saved the route service contract schedule.) {br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_02_00|Generate Route Appointments] form, you can filter the list of schedules by route, and you should select the date range for which you want to generate schedules in the system. You can then generate route executions for all listed route service contract schedules or only those you select. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Generate_Route_Appointments|To Generate Route Appointments].{br}

You can process the route executions with the generated appointments. For details, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CON_Route_Processing|Route Processing Workflow].
==Viewing and Canceling Generation Processes==
On the '''Run History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_02_00|Generate Route Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS500200|FS500200]) form, you can view information about the generation process, such as the date until which the appointments have been generated and the date when the appointments have been generated.{br}

If you have accidentally generated the wrong appointments, you can cancel the latest generation process by clicking '''Roll Back Latest Generation Process''' on the '''Run History''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_02_00|Generate Route Appointments] form. {br}

Once you have canceled the latest generation process, the schedules used to generate appointments during this process appear on the '''Schedules''' tab (for the date range that was specified for the generation process). You can view and change the schedules&rsquo; details, and generate them again or delete them from the system. You can cancel all generated schedules by rolling back each schedule generation process one by one.

For the service contracts with standardized billing, at the end of each billing period, you have to generate a billing document (that is, an AR invoice or sales order) for the customer. The document includes the services and non-stock items that are covered by the contract, as well as other items included in the appointments related to the contract that were performed during the billing period. For the items that are covered by the contract, the document includes the price specified in the contract. If quantity of the items has been exceeded during the period, the overage quantity of items is included in the billing document with the overage price specified for the contract.{br}

In this topic, you will read about how to generate billing documents for the route service contracts with standardized billing in the system.
==Generating Invoices and Creating Batches==
You specify the invoice generation settings (such as the type of the document to be generated) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_04_00|Route Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100400|FS100400]) for as described in [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__CNF_Overview_Route#_af0a5e3e-847e-4b3a-b58d-af14a02ba5e9|Initial Configuration in the Route Management Module].{br}

You generate the billing documents on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_13_00|Generate Invoices from Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS501300|FS501300]) form. You specify the date of document creation, select all listed service contracts for which you want to bill a customer or multiple customers, and generate the documents. For details on how to generate billing documents, see [HelpRoot_FieldServices\FS__HOW_To_Generate_Invoice_for_Contract|To Generate Billing Documents for Contracts with Standardized Billing]. {br}

When you generate these billing documents, the system creates a batch of generated billing documents on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_61_00|Contract Invoice Generation Batches] ([~/?ScreenId=FS306100|FS306100]) form. The system assigns the batch a reference number in accordance with the numbering sequence assigned to batches in the '''Posting Batch Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_50_13_00|Generate Invoices from Contracts] form, you click the batch number in the '''Batch Nbr.''' column to view information on the batch. The system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_61_00|Contract Invoice Generation Batches] ([~/?ScreenId=FS306100|FS306100]) form with the batch. On this form, you can find the contract reference number, the invoice date, the customer, the branch, and the next billing date for the contract.
==Processing Billing Documents==
The appropriate employees process the generated billing documents. To open a generated billing document for the selected batch, you click the billing document number in the '''Document Nbr.''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_61_00|Contract Invoice Generation Batches] ([~/?ScreenId=FS306100|FS306100]) form, and then process it in the system.

The week code is a one- to four-digit recurrence system that you can use to reschedule the appointment in a multiple of 4 week interval. {br}

The week code is directly related to the calendar. If a week with a 4-digit recurrence is defined, the rest of the calendar can be calculated. {br}

The advantage of the week code system is that without generating a recurrence of an appointment, you can easily calculate the previous and next recurrences that have taken place or will take place. The disadvantage is that the recurrence can be set only in multiples of four weeks (that is, for example, every four or eight weeks. ((({S:Warn}The week codes are currently used for validation purposes in the Route Management module. The recurrence of the route will be taken from the Route Management recurrence form.

== Generation of the Calendar ==
Because the week code is calculated on a fixed calendar, the first step is to generate the calendar. This will define the correspondence between the week code and the calendar weeks.{br}

To generate the weekcode calendar, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_59_00|Calendar Week Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=FS205900|FS205900]) form.

 The digits in the week codes indicate the following: [anchor|#_35bf7759-1bcf-4716-acb0-700ad7ce2e28]
* P1: The first digit can be 1, 2, 3 or 4, and this recurrence will happen every four weeks. 

For example, if a route is set for week code 1, starting on the fourth week of January, the route will happen every 4 weeks. But if the week code is 2, it will also happen every four weeks but starting in the fifth week of January. ((({S:Hint} The recurrence can be more than one week code. For example, a route can be on the week codes 1, 2, 3, or 4, meaning that it will be every week, or it can be 1,3 or 2,4, meaning it will be every two weeks, starting on the first or second week of the year.

* P2: The second digit can be ''A'' or ''B'', and the combination of the first and second digit will happen every eight weeks. 

For example, if a route is set for''1B'', the first appointment of the year will be in the fourth week of January, and the second appointment will be in the third week of March (that is, eight weeks later). [anchor|#_8163f463-caf0-4b97-b798-2c3074d549d2]
* P3: The third digit can be ''C'', ''D'', ''E'', or ''F'', and the combination of the first, second, and third digits will happen every 16 weeks. 

For example, if a route is set for ''1BF'', the first appointment of the year will be in the fourth week of Januar,y and the second appointment will be in the third week of May (that is, 16 weeks later). [anchor|#_9e15b136-0e2d-4d69-8b50-acd67a8842df]
* P4: The fourth digit can be ''S'', ''T'', ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', ''Y'', or ''Z''. The combination of the first, second, third, and fourth digits will happen every 32 weeks. 

For example, if a route is set for ''1BFZ'', the first appointment of the year will be in the fourth week of January, and the second appointment will be in the last week of August or first week of September (that is, 32 weeks later).

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Creating Week Codes The week code is a one- to four-digit recurrence system that you can use to reschedule the    appointment in     a    multiple of 4 week interval .  The week code is directly related to the calendar. If a week with a 4-digit recurrence is    defined, the rest of the calendar can be calculated.  The advantage of the week code system is that without generating a recurrence of an    appointment, you can easily calculate the previous and next recurrences that have taken place or    will take place. The disadvantage is that the recurrence can be set only in multiples of four    weeks (that is, for example, every four or eight weeks.  The week codes are currently used for validation purposes in the Route    Management module. The recurrence of the route will be taken from the     Route    Management recurrence form .   Generation of the Calendar  Because the week code is calculated on a fixed calendar, the first step is to generate the     calendar. This will define the correspondence between the week code and the calendar weeks. To generate the weekcode calendar, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS205900|FS205900]) Calendar Week Codes (SD205900)     form.  Structure of the week codes  The digits in the week codes indicate the following:   P1: The first digit can be 1, 2, 3 or 4, and this recurrence will happen every four weeks.      For example, if a route is set for week code 1, starting on the fourth week of January, the     route will happen every 4 weeks. But if the week code is 2, it will also happen every four weeks     but starting in the fifth week of January.   The recurrence can be more than one week code. For example, a route can be on     the week codes 1, 2, 3, or 4, meaning that it will be every week, or it can be      1,3      or 2,4, meaning it will be every two weeks, starting on the first or second week of the year.   P2: The second digit can be  A  or  B , and the combination of the first and      second digit will happen every eight weeks.  For example, if a route is set  for 1B , the first appointment of the year will be in the fourth week of January, and the     second appointment will be in the third week of March (that is, eight weeks later).   P3: The third digit can be  C ,  D ,  E , or  F , and the combination      of the first, second, and third digits will happen every 16 weeks.  For example, if a route is set for  1BF , the first appointment of the year will be in     the fourth week of Januar,y and the second appointment will be in the third week of May (that     is, 16 weeks later).   P4: The fourth digit can be  S ,  T ,  U ,  V ,  W ,  X ,        Y , or  Z . The combination of the first, second, third, and fourth digits will      happen every 32 weeks.  For example, if a route is set for  1BFZ , the first appointment of the year will be in     the fourth week of January, and the second appointment will be in the last week of August or     first week of September (that is, 32 weeks later).
