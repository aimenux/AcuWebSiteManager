The Inventory module provides real-time access to stock item availability data configured in accordance with your company&rsquo;s policies. By using the Inventory module, you can maintain a perpetual inventory system while also performing physical inventories as full inventory counts and counts by cycles. In Acumatica ERP, you can track items by either lot or serial numbers, as well as by expiration dates. By using multiple valuation methods, you can accurately maintain item costs and trace cost flows. By using flexible posting settings, you can meet any regulatory requirements.{br}

The full functionality of the Inventory module is available only if the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}
==Stock and Non-Stock Inventory Items==
Inventory items are the goods, products, services, and component parts recorded to and tracked in your system database. Inventory items can be divided into two major categories, stock and non-stock items, based on how they are handled and accounted for. By using functionality of restriction groups, you can control visibility of particular inventory items to employees. For more information, see the following topics: 
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Items|Inventory Items]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Stock_Items|Stock Items]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Non-Stock_Item_Support|Non-Stock Items in the Inventory Module]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security]

==Flexible Item Identifiers and Support of Alternative IDs==
By using configurable inventory IDs, you can uniquely identify inventory items. If you use subitems in your system, you can further subdivide items by size, color, material, and other criteria that apply to your business. You can easily gather additional business-specific data about inventory items by configuring custom fields, called ''attributes''. Also, on purchase and sales orders, you can use barcodes or vendor or customer alternative IDs to find items or record item information. For more information, see the following topics: 
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_IDs_and_Subitem_Codes|Inventory Subitems]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Item_Attributes|Inventory Item Attributes]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Cross-References|Item Cross-References]
*[HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Barcode_Support|Barcode Support]

==Global and Item-Specific UOMs==
You can use an unlimited number of units of measure (UOMs) in your system. Commonly used units of measure—liters, gallons, pounds, and kilograms—can be defined globally and then used as base units of measure for specific item classes or particular products. You can define conversion rules between UOMs (such as pounds and kilograms).{br}

You can specify UOMs and conversion rules at the item-class and item level—cases or boxes intended for different products can be of different capacities. Once you have defined conversion rules, the system automatically makes conversions to the correct unit of measure when necessary.{br}

If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, for each item you can define, in addition to the base unit, the purchase UOM to be used to measure item quantity on purchase orders and receipts and the sales unit to measure the item quantities on sales orders and invoices. Prices for base UOMs and sales UOMs can be set as independent prices, if needed. {br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Units_of_Measure_and_Conversions|Units of Measure and Conversions].
==Multiple Warehouses and Locations==
In Acumatica ERP, you can maintain a complex warehouse structure, defining multiple warehouses with multiple locations within each. This functionality is available if you enable the ''Multiple Warehouses'' and ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' features on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

By configuring segmentation for location identifiers, you can maintain a hierarchy of rooms, rows, levels, shelves, bins, and other divisions. For each location, you can define which inventory operations can be performed there. You can also specify a primary inventory item or primary item class, and set up validation so that if a preferred item is specified and the validation is turned on, only the preferred item can be received at the location.{br}

By using security functionality, you can restrict the visibility of warehouse information to groups of authorized users. For more information, see the following topics:
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Warehouses|Warehouses in Acumatica ERP]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Multiple_Warehouses|Multiple Warehouses]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Warehouse_Locations|Warehouse Locations]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_and_Warehouse_Security|Warehouse Security]

==Flexible Posting Settings==
You can set up the system to automatically update the General Ledger on release of inventory documents. Posting classes assigned to inventory items define the rules for selecting particular General Ledger accounts and subaccounts to be updated when transactions with the items are performed. Reason codes for inventory transactions provide the offset accounts to be updated, depending on the type of inventory transactions. For more information, see the following topics:
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_GL_Accounts_Inventory|Posting Settings in the Inventory Module]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Posting_Classes__Definition_and_Usage|Posting Classes in Inventory]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Reason_Codes__Definition_and_Usage|Reason Codes for Inventory]

==Inventory Transactions==
The Inventory module supports the following types of documents, recording the same-name inventory transactions: receipt, issue, adjustment, transfer, and kit assembly. Inventory documents facilitate accounting for transactions that result in changing inventory quantities and costs.{br}

For more information about inventory transactions, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Transactions|Inventory Transactions].
==Availability Calculation==
 Acumatica ERP provides real-time visibility into the available inventory levels. The way availability data is calculated can be configured in accordance with the policies set in your company. Availability calculation rules are specified for item classes. You can create multiple rules with different calculation settings and assign them to different item classes. The availability data of items is shown on sales orders, purchase orders, and kit assemblies. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Availability_Calculation|Availability Calculation]. 
==Lot and Serial Number Tracking==
With the Inventory module, you can track stock items by lot or serial numbers and by expiration dates if the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form. Acumatica ERP provides flexible numbering schemes for lot and serial numbers, and the ability to track different products differently. For more information about the use of lot and serial numbers, see the following topics:
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Lot_and_Serial_Numbers|Lot and Serial Numbers]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Lot_and_Serial_Number_Tracking|Lot and Serial Number Tracking]

==Kit Assembling==
Some stock or non-stock items may be kits made up of other inventory items. Non-stock kits can include both non-stock and stock components and are not recorded in the Inventory module. Stock components of non-stock kits are processed as if they are managed separately not within a kit. Stock kits also can include both stock and non-stock components but are recorded in the Inventory module and are regarded as individual items.{br}

For more information about kits, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Accounting_for_Kits|Inventory Item Kits].
==Inventory Valuation==
By using a perpetual inventory system, which Acumatica ERP enables, your company can estimate the total cost of its inventory at any moment, because on-hand quantities and inventory account balances are updated with every transaction, purchase, or sale. Periodic revision of standard costs for items with standard cost valuation methods results in the revaluation of the cost of inventory. Periodic updates of base prices can be performed automatically. For more information on inventory valuation, see the following topics:
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_The_Cost_of_Inventory|The Cost of Inventory]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Base_Prices|Default Prices]

==Physical Inventories==
By using Acumatica ERP, your company can maintain a perpetual inventory system with the combination of full physical inventory and cycle counting that best fits the company policies and goals. Count data can be imported from Excel files or entered manually by multiple employees working simultaneously on multiple computers. The information from these counts provides company managers with exact values of stock levels. For more information, see the following topics:
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Planning_for_Physical_Inventory|Configuration of Physical Inventory]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Physical_Inventory_Types|Types of Physical Inventory]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Cycle_Counting_Configuration|Cycle Counting Configuration]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Ranking_Methods|Inventory Ranking Methods]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Configuration_of_PI_Counts_by_ABC_Codes|Configuration of Physical Inventory Counts by ABC Codes]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Physical_Inventory_Counts|Physical Inventory Counts]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Preparation_for_Physical_Count|Preparation for Physical Count]

==Automated Replenishment==
In Acumatica ERP, you can configure automated replenishment of stock items. Flexible, automated replenishment ensures that for items requiring replenishment, the right quantities will be calculated and listed on automatically generated purchase orders. Moreover, you can use the predicted average daily demand, calculated with the help of demand forecasting methods, to periodically update the values of replenishment parameters (such as maximum quantity, reorder point, and safety stock) to more precisely calculate the quantities required for replenishment. For more information, see the following topics: 
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Configuration_of_Automated_Replenishment|Configuration of Automated Replenishment]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Automated_Replenishment|Automated Replenishment]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Replenishment_Parameters|Replenishment Methods and Their Parameters]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Replenishment_Based_on_Demand_Forecast_Model|Replenishment Parameters Based on Demand Forecast ]

==Financial Period Closing in the Inventory module==
When accountants close financial periods in the system, they must close periods in all modules that your Acumatica ERP instance uses. Before closing periods in the Inventory module you have to review all unprocessed transactions and process or delete them. For more information, see the following topics:[anchor|#_7efc7bae-f476-4776-a556-7edeb5ecca0e]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Financial_Period_Closing_Inventory|Financial Period Closing in the Inventory Module]
*[HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Reconciliation_IN_Account_GL_Account|Reconciliation of the Cost of Inventory with the Account Balance]

==Other Features and Options==
The Inventory module also provides the following features:
*The ability to quickly add product images to the inventory item record.
*Tracking of items by product workgroup or product manager.
*Item availability data displayed when you create a sales or a purchase order.
*The ability to print count sheets, tags, and item and location labels, to facilitate the counting process.
*For perishable items, tracking of expiration dates, with alerts displayed about expired items.
*The ability to set up the automatic issue of items by expiration date.
*Segmented identifiers for locations, to make it easier to locate stock. By using segments, you can define further detail levels of locations, such as rooms, shelves, and bins.

If your organization keeps any physical items on site that are currently unused but expected to be used or sold, it uses storage for these items. Your storage can be as small as a shelf with dozens of office supplies in a back office or as large as multiple physical warehouses with billions of goods situated in different regions or even countries.{br}

If you want to track your stored items in Acumatica ERP, you can use the functionality of warehouses and locations and choose the approach that best fits your business. You can configure a single warehouse or multiple warehouses. Within each warehouse, you can define a single location or multiple locations.

In Acumatica ERP, a warehouse does not necessarily represent a physical building where your inventory is stocked. You can divide a large physical storage space into multiple areas and define each area as a warehouse in Acumatica ERP. A warehouse can even be virtual: for example, you might consider all goods that are on the way from the supplier to you as being located in a goods-in-transit warehouse.{br}

You can configure any of the following warehouse structures:[anchor|#_35f885f0-c5df-4081-a57a-d30d433baf0c]
*One warehouse with one location: You use this structure when you have a small variety of inventory items and it’s not important for you to track in which room or on which shelf these items are stored. For more information, see [[#_ee36f3b7-b245-4beb-98e0-07e76b0e6e7c|Basic Warehouse Structure].
*One warehouse with multiple locations: You use this structure when you have one space and need to track the locations within it and the items in those locations. For example, you might have one physical room with many numbered shelves, or multiple rooms with shelves and boxes, and you may want to register in the system the exact placement of each inventory item.
*Multiple warehouses with one location in each warehouse: You use this structure when you store items in multiple physical rooms or buildings, and each storage place holds a small number of items, which warehouse employees can easily find without knowing a more specific location of items.
*Multiple warehouses with multiple locations in each warehouse: You use this structure when you have a distributed network of large warehouses that hold a wide variety of goods in different locations.
*Multiple warehouses with one location or multiple locations in each warehouse: You use this structure when you have multiple warehouses, which vary in terms of whether they have multiple locations within them. For example, when you have a large distribution center from where goods are sent to multiple small warehouses.

For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Multiple_Warehouses|Multiple Warehouses] and [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Warehouse_Locations|Warehouse Locations].[anchor|#_ee36f3b7-b245-4beb-98e0-07e76b0e6e7c]
==Basic Warehouse Structure==
When you have just a few items to keep in a small storage area, you can use the basic functionality of warehouses in Acumatica ERP. The basic functionality is available when you have the following license settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form:[anchor|#_087c12ff-cd47-43b9-b861-ada15b13d190]
*The ''Inventory'' feature is enabled.
*The ''Multiple Warehouses'' and ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' features (which provide more advanced functionality) are disabled.

The system creates the default warehouse and assigns ''MAIN'' as the warehouse ID when you configure the settings of the Inventory module on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. ((({S:Hint}The ID of the only warehouse, ''MAIN'', is not displayed on data entry forms for simplicity. However, this warehouse ID will be used automatically in all inventory transactions.
))){br}

If needed, you can change the identifier of the ''MAIN'' warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Change ID''' on the form toolbar and specifying a new identifier in the dialog box that opens.{br}

When the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is not enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form displays only the '''Warehouse ID''' box. The following settings are specified for the default warehouse but are hidden from this form:[anchor|#_884ee7a7-e307-4ed8-be29-931132a439e8]
*'''Replenishment Class''': ''Purchase''
* '''Default Cost of Returns''': ''Average''

For the default warehouse, the system creates a default location that the goods will be received to and issued from and assigns ''MAIN'' as the location ID. The location settings are not displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form if the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, but the ''MAIN'' location has the following settings: [anchor|#_a06ea460-5902-413c-996d-eb2b2835f3b5]
*'''Active''': Selected
*'''Include in Qty. Available''': Selected
*'''Cost Separately''': Cleared
*'''Sales Allowed''': Selected
*'''Receipts Allowed''': Selected
*'''Transfers Allowed''': Selected
*'''Assembly Allowed''': Selected

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Warehouses in  Acumatica ERPIf your organization keeps any physical items on site that are currently unused but expected         to be used or sold, it uses storage for these items. Your storage can be as small as a shelf         with dozens of office supplies in a back office or as large as multiple physical warehouses         with billions of goods situated in different regions or even countries. If you want to track your stored items in  Acumatica ERP, you can use the functionality of warehouses and locations and choose the approach that         best fits your business.

When your organization has multiple buildings, storage rooms, or other facilities for storing inventory items, you can create multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP to process inventory appropriately for each warehouse.{br}

With the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can create any number of warehouses, even virtual warehouses, in the way that best fits your business with specific settings for each warehouse. In this topic, you will read about multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Multiple Warehouses==
After you have enabled the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form and configured inventory preferences (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Configuration_of_Basic_Inventory|Configuration of Basic Inventory]), you can create as many warehouses as you need on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, if you have multiple warehouses defined, you can perform transfers between warehouses, relocating stock items as needed, or you can use one warehouse as a source of replenishment for other warehouses by having purchased goods delivered to only this warehouse and then transferring the goods to other warehouses.{br}

To create and configure a warehouse, you do the following:[anchor|#_16f3d782-aa70-40c3-a626-d05fc00f8c64]
#Optional: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form, you review the default settings of the ''INSITE'' segmented key, which is used for warehouse identifiers, and adjust the settings of the key to meet your needs. You can configure identifiers to have one segment or multiple segments. If you are going to use multiple segments, you need to determine how many segments (and of what length) will be used, whether the segments should be validated (and if so, what kind of values are allowed), and whether an auto-numbered segment will be used. For details on segmented keys, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].
#On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form, you create a warehouse and specify its settings, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Warehouse|To Create a Warehouse].
#:((({S:Hint}If you want to specify warehouse-specific General Ledger accounts, make sure that all the necessary accounts have been created in the system before you start creating warehouses.
)))
#Optional: On the '''Location Table''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form, you specify the locations for the warehouse. For more information about warehouse locations, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Warehouse_Locations|Warehouse Locations].
#:((({S:Hint}The '''Location Table''' tab is displayed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form only if the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form.
)))
#Optional: You configure warehouse security, such as restricting access to forms based on user roles and configuring the visibility of particular warehouses to appropriate users. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_and_Warehouse_Security|Warehouse Security].

==Warehouse as a Source of GL Accounts and Subaccounts for Posting Classes==
A posting class, which is specified for each stock or non-stock item, is a group of settings that provide the default values for the purchase, sales, and inventory transactions with the item and define how these transactions will be posted to the General Ledger. One of these default values is the source of General Ledger accounts and subaccounts to be used for the item, which can be a source of default General Ledger accounts and subaccounts for an inventory item. If you store inventory items of the same category in multiple warehouses, and each warehouse has specific General Ledger accounts and subaccounts specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, you can use a warehouse as a source of default General Ledger accounts and subaccounts for an inventory item. You define the source of accounts and subaccounts that the system should use in a posting class.{br}

For example, you can have one inventory account for each warehouse. In this case, you can specify the needed inventory account in the warehouse settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form and specify the warehouse as the source of inventory account in the posting class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form.{br}

For details about how to specify a warehouse as a source of General Ledger accounts and subaccounts for a posting class, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Use_Warehouse_GL_Accounts_and_Subaccounts_in_Posting_Classes|To Use Warehouse General Ledger Accounts and Subaccounts in a Posting Class].
==Warehouse-Specific Settings for Stock Items==
If the details of stocking a particular inventory item vary in different warehouses, you specify the details for the item at each warehouse on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. You can view these warehouse-specific settings of items on the '''Warehouse Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. {br}

For each stock item at a particular warehouse, you can specify the following:[anchor|#_70a75297-0c49-4d13-a94f-9362dcfde769]
*The default locations for issuing and receiving the item at this warehouse
*The inventory account and subaccount to be used for the stock item at this warehouse
*The ABC code and movement class assigned to the item when it is at this warehouse
*The replenishment settings for the item when it is stocked in this warehouse
*The cost statistics related to this item at this warehouse

In the following cases, the system adds a new record to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form:[anchor|#_7b50a17c-9c56-4974-b283-843a50add4b8]
*When any user specifies or changes the default warehouse for an inventory item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
*When any user releases the first inventory receipt to a new warehouse (or other transaction that increases inventory, such as the receiving part of an inventory transfer).

==Warehouse-Specific Prices==
If you have multiple warehouses defined in the system, you can define warehouse-specific sales prices and vendor prices for items. You can define the price of the item and select the warehouse for this price. If no warehouse is specified for a price on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) forms, this price is applied to all warehouses that are defined in the system. A price that has a warehouse specified has a higher priority than a price of the same type with no warehouse selected. For example, a promotional customer price that is specific to a warehouse has a higher priority than a promotional customer price with no warehouse specified. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__CON_PriceLists|Multiple Price Lists] and [HelpRoot_Financials\AP__CON_Vendor_PriceLists|Maintaining Vendor Price Lists].

You define the source         of accounts and subaccounts that the system should use in a posting class. For example, you can have one inventory account for each warehouse. In this case, you can         specify the needed inventory account in the warehouse settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form and specify the warehouse as the source of inventory         account in the posting class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form. For details about how to specify a warehouse as a source of General Ledger accounts and         subaccounts for a posting class, see  To Use Warehouse General Ledger Accounts and Subaccounts in a Posting Class. Warehouse-Specific Settings for Stock Items If the details of stocking a particular inventory item vary in different warehouses, you         specify the details for the item at each warehouse on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details         (IN204500) form. You can view these warehouse-specific settings of items on the            Warehouse Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items         (IN202500) form.  For each stock item at a particular warehouse, you can specify the following: The default locations for issuing and receiving the item at this warehouse The inventory account and subaccount to be used for the stock item at this           warehouse The ABC code and movement class assigned to the item when it is at this warehouse The replenishment settings for the item when it is stocked in this warehouse The cost statistics related to this item at this warehouse In the following cases, the system adds a new record to the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details         (IN204500) form: When any user specifies or changes the default warehouse for an inventory item on the               ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. When any user releases the first inventory receipt to a new warehouse (or other           transaction that increases inventory, such as the receiving part of an inventory           transfer). Warehouse-Specific Prices If you have multiple warehouses defined in the system, you can define warehouse-specific sales         prices and vendor prices for items. You can define the price of the item and select the         warehouse for this price. If no warehouse is specified for a price on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets (AP202010) or   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) forms,         this price is applied to all warehouses that are defined in the system. A price that has a         warehouse specified has a higher priority than a price of the same type with no warehouse         selected. For example, a promotional customer price that is specific to a warehouse has a         higher priority than a promotional customer price with no warehouse specified.

In Acumatica ERP, you can configure multiple locations in each warehouse to best fit the logistics established in your company. You can reserve specific locations for sales, receipts, transfers, goods to be returned to vendors, and goods returned by customers.{br}

You can assign different pick priorities to locations, to empty certain locations more quickly while using others less frequently.{br}

In this topic, you will find information about the creation and use of warehouse locations in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Default Warehouse Locations==
For each warehouse created in the system, the system automatically creates a default location (with the ''MAIN'' location ID, which you can change later) that the goods will be received to and issued from. The ''MAIN'' location has the following settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form:[anchor|#_7550d797-3671-4129-a5b7-6f79118fa38b]
*'''Active''': Selected
*'''Include in Qty. Available''': Selected
*'''Cost Separately''': Cleared
*'''Sales Allowed''': Selected
*'''Receipts Allowed''': Selected
*'''Transfers Allowed''': Selected
*'''Assembly Allowed''': Selected
((({S:Hint}These location settings are displayed on the '''Location Table''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form only if the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form; if it is not enabled, the tab is not shown on the form but the settings listed above are used internally. 
)))
==Configuration of Warehouse Locations==
With the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure multiple locations for each warehouse. If it is enabled, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, you can view and change the settings of the default location and define the other locations for each warehouse.{br}

You do the following to create and configure warehouse locations in Acumatica ERP:[anchor|#_d7c2f705-dd65-491b-af60-a7261263a4c8]
#Optional: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form, you review the structure of the ''INLOCATION'' segmented key, which defines the identifiers for warehouse locations. If you want to create a hierarchy of locations (site, aisle, pallet, bin, and so forth), you can configure location identifiers that consist of multiple segments, with each segment denoting a specific level in this hierarchy. For example, suppose that you have three racks, each with four shelves, in a warehouse. A location identifier can look as follows: ''Rn-SHm'', where ''Rn'' is the number of the rack (such as ''R2'') and ''SHm'' is the number of the shelf in the rack (such as ''SH4''). For more information about segmented keys, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].
#On the '''Location Table''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form for each warehouse, you add each location and specify its settings, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Warehouse_Location|To Create Warehouse Locations]. You add as many locations as you need.
#:((({S:Hint}To create similar configurations of locations in multiple warehouses, you can export the location table to an Excel file (with the <tt>.xlsx</tt> format) and import settings from the file to the same warehouse or another warehouse and change the setting as needed. For details on importing the settings from an Excel file, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\Exporting_to_Excel|Integration with Excel].
)))
#Optional: On the '''Location Table''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form, you specify the default locations (which simplify data entry on purchase receipts and sales orders) for inventory operations in the following boxes:
#*'''Receiving Location''': The default receiving location for stock items in the warehouse.
#*'''Shipping Location''': The default shipping location for the warehouse.
#*'''RMA Location''': The location used for all operations involving return merchandise authorization (RMA). The returned goods will be delivered to the location specified in this box, regardless of the warehouse location selected by default for the receipt of these goods.
#*'''Drop-Ship Location''': The location used for drop-ship orders and all inventory documents that are automatically generated for drop-ship orders.
#Optional: In the '''Location Entry''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form, you specify the option that indicates whether you want to allow users to add new locations on the fly when they are entering inventory documents. You can view locations added by users on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form and modify their settings if needed.

==Priorities of Warehouse Locations==
If you store inventory items of the same type (such as apples) in multiple locations within the same warehouse, the system has to find the appropriate warehouse location from which to pick the items when a user creates a shipment for a sales order. For each location, you can specify the pick priority, which will help the system to select a correct location if it finds multiple locations that have the item.{br}

For example, suppose that you store a dairy product with that can be kept for one week. You purchase this dairy product every day and store it in two locations of the warehouse: A and B. In Location A, you store a variant of the dairy product that can be kept from five to seven days. In Location B, you store a variant of the dairy produce that can be kept from two to four days. You can assign the highest pick priority to Location B so that dairy product with an earlier expiration date are shipped first.{br}

The way the system finds a location from which the line item&rsquo;s ordered quantity will be picked depends on whether the applicable sales order is related to a project and task and on the location settings—whether the '''Project ID''' and '''Task ID''' columns are filled in for the location on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form—as follows:[anchor|#_cc32c50c-76e4-4745-bd08-7901fa87e14a]
*If the sales order is not related to any project: The system searches for the applicable location among all available locations and selects the location with the highest pick priority.
*If the sales order is related to a project and a task—that is, if a project ID is specified for the sales order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form and a task ID is specified for a sales order line on this form): The system selects the first applicable location it finds by using the following search priority (from highest to lowest):
**A location for which the project ID and task ID are the same as the project ID and task ID of the sales order
**A location whose project ID is the same as the project ID of the sales order and whose task ID is unspecified
**A location for which the project ID and task ID are not specified 
**A location for which the project ID is the same as the project ID of a sales order and for which the task ID differs from the task ID of the sales order line

If both sales orders related to projects and sales orders unrelated to projects are used in your system, and you want to ensure that locations in shipments match project codes in sales orders, we recommend that you specify the lowest pick priority (that is, the highest value in the '''Pick Priority''' column on the '''Location Table''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form) for those locations that are associated with projects. As a result, for the sales orders that are unrelated to projects, the system will search among the non-project locations first; if no applicable non-project location has been found, the system will continue to search in the locations that are related to projects.

Configuration of Warehouse Locations With the  Multiple Warehouse Locations  feature enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can configure multiple locations for each         warehouse. If it is enabled, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, you can         view and change the settings of the default location and define the other locations for each         warehouse.

An organization can have multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP, and different groups of employees may work with these warehouses in the system. To limit in the system the set of employees who work with a particular warehouse, you can create restriction groups to display the warehouse for only employees who are responsible for tasks that involve this warehouse. If the employees who work with the same warehouse perform only specific tasks (such as accepting goods and creating purchase orders), you can provide these employees with access to only the forms that they should use.{br}

In this topic, you can find information about configuring the security of warehouses in Acumatica ERP.[anchor|#_5ff7281a-de00-416b-8579-a326526bab78]((({S:Hint}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of warehouses are the following:[anchor|#_4bfda738-cf0c-4f2b-9077-d6ff655fa566]
*Managing access to forms based on employees&rsquo; functional roles: If employees perform specific tasks (such as receiving goods and creating purchase orders), you can provide the employees access to the forms they use in their work, and revoke access for forms that they shouldn&rsquo;t use. For details, see [[#_29384b43-8e49-46d4-8c83-0a2c8801139d|Access to Forms Based on Roles].
*Managing the visibility of particular warehouses by user: If you have created multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP, you can restrict the visibility of warehouses to users on forms by using restriction groups. For details, see [[#_4134d0c6-086f-45f5-b43f-a3d0dbe76eec|Visibility of Warehouses by User].
*:((({S:Hint}You can create and manage multiple warehouses in Acumatica ERP only if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))

In addition to managing the visibility of warehouses in whole, you can restrict the visibility of particular inventory items. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__con_Restriction_Groups_for_Subitems|Inventory Item Security].[anchor|#_29384b43-8e49-46d4-8c83-0a2c8801139d]
==Access to Forms Based on Roles==
By using the forms of the User Security submodule, you can use user roles in Acumatica ERP to give employees access to forms related to working with warehouses. A role can correspond to an area of responsibility for an employee who performs warehouse-related tasks, such as creating purchase orders, accepting goods, and preparing replenishment. If needed, you can assign multiple roles to an employee. For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access].{br}

Consider the following examples of roles for employees who work with inventory and order management:[anchor|#_3aed05a7-1529-4e93-8536-70cafc558db4]
*''Supervisor'': A role for an employee who configures the Inventory submodule and manages work with the submodule. This role should have access to the forms related to inventory processes, such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.
*''Data Entry Clerk'': A role for an employee who creates documents on data entry forms. You should provide access to such forms as [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]).
*''Purchasing Manager'': A role for an employee who is responsible for replenishment. For this role, you should provide access to the '''Replenishment''' node of the '''Processes''' tab of the Inventory module.
[anchor|#_4134d0c6-086f-45f5-b43f-a3d0dbe76eec]
==Visibility of Warehouses by User==
By default, all employees who have access to forms of the inventory and order management modules can see all warehouses created in the system. By using the forms of the Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system so that each warehouse is displayed only to users who work with this warehouse. You can use restriction groups to set up the visibility of warehouses to employees. For details on restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

For example, suppose that your system has the ''Wholesale'' and ''Retail'' warehouses defined, and you need to configure the visibility of these warehouses to users as follows:[anchor|#_8a8cd601-eb3c-4042-b8d7-32a182dd9acc]
*User S is a supervisor who should configure and manage both warehouses.
*User C1 is a clerk who enters documents for the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
*User C2 is a clerk who enters documents for the ''Retail'' warehouse.

To configure the visibility of warehouses according to this example, you do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_20_00|Warehouse Access] ([~/?ScreenId=IN102000|IN102000]) form:[anchor|#_3d9fa191-30d8-42a0-8030-9c8f57fcfbfa]
#You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): ''Group 1'' for the ''Wholesale'' warehouse, and ''Group 2'' for the ''Retail'' warehouse.
#In Group 1, you include User S, User C1, and the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
#In Group 2, you include User S, User C2, and the ''Retail'' warehouse.

The resulting visibility of warehouses will be the following:[anchor|#_edda2fc2-790d-43d1-8446-7928a3efb85e]
*User S can see both the ''Wholesale'' and ''Retail'' warehouses.
*User C1 can see only the ''Wholesale'' warehouse.
*User C2 can see only the ''Retail'' warehouse.
[anchor|#_7ed1ab5a-0a06-4b9a-a2ec-4491a9f59cb4]
==Forms for Warehouse Security==
In the following table, you can find the list of forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with warehouses and tasks that you can solve by using each form.[anchor|#_4d607671-c1fd-412f-a1ea-560c07f9fcc7]

In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Usage Scenarios The most common scenarios of managing the security of warehouses are the                     following: Managing access to forms based on employees' functional roles: If employees                         perform specific tasks (such as receiving goods and creating purchase                         orders), you can provide the employees access to the forms they use in their                         work, and revoke access for forms that they shouldn't use. For details, see                              Access to Forms Based on Roles Access to Forms Based on Roles. Managing the visibility of particular warehouses by user: If you have                         created multiple warehouses in  Acumatica ERP, you can restrict the visibility of warehouses to users on forms by using                         restriction groups. For details, see  Visibility of Warehouses by User Visibility of Warehouses by User. You can create and manage multiple warehouses in                                  Acumatica ERP only if the  Multiple Warehouses  feature is enabled on the                                   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)                             form. In addition to managing the visibility of warehouses in whole, you can restrict                     the visibility of particular  inventory items. For                     details, see  Inventory Item Security. Access to Forms Based on Roles By using the forms of the User Security submodule, you can use user roles in  Acumatica ERP to give employees access to forms related to working with warehouses. A role                     can correspond to an area of responsibility for an employee who performs                     warehouse-related tasks, such as creating purchase orders, accepting goods, and                     preparing replenishment. If needed, you can assign multiple roles to an                     employee. For more information about user roles, see  Role-Based Access. Consider the following examples of roles for employees who work with inventory                     and order management: Supervisor : A role for an employee who configures the Inventory                         submodule and manages work with the submodule. This role should have access                         to the forms related to inventory processes, such as the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. Data Entry Clerk : A role for an employee who creates documents on                         data entry forms. You should provide access to such forms as   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000), or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000). Purchasing Manager : A role for an employee who is responsible for                         replenishment. For this role, you should provide access to the                              Replenishment  node of the                              Processes  tab of the Inventory module. Visibility of Warehouses by User By default, all employees who have access to forms of the inventory and order management modules                     can see all warehouses created in the system. By using the forms of the                     Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system so that each warehouse                     is displayed only to users who work with this warehouse. You can use restriction                     groups to set up the visibility of warehouses to employees. For details on                     restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. For example, suppose that your system has the  Wholesale  and  Retail  warehouses                     defined, and you need to configure the visibility of these warehouses to users                     as follows: User S is a supervisor who should configure and manage both warehouses. User C1 is a clerk who enters documents for the  Wholesale                          warehouse. User C2 is a clerk who enters documents for the  Retail                          warehouse. To configure the visibility of warehouses according to this example, you do the following on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN102000|IN102000]) Warehouse Access (IN102000)                     form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct restriction):  Group 1  for                         the  Wholesale  warehouse, and  Group 2  for the  Retail                          warehouse. In Group 1, you include User S, User C1, and the  Wholesale  warehouse. In Group 2, you include User S, User C2, and the  Retail  warehouse. The resulting visibility of warehouses will be the following: User S can see both the  Wholesale  and  Retail  warehouses. User C1 can see only the  Wholesale  warehouse. User C2 can see only the  Retail  warehouse. Forms for Warehouse Security In the following table, you can find the list of forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with warehouses and tasks that you can solve by using each form.

Before you start using the inventory functionality in Acumatica ERP, you need to specify basic settings, as described in this topic.
==Configuration of Basic Inventory==
Before you start configuring the Inventory module, you make sure that the following is done in the system:[anchor|#_6691133e-62ec-4f5c-9d92-6ebe91ce9171]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the ''Inventory'' feature under the ''Standard Inventory'' group of features are enabled. By enabling these features, you activate the basic functionality of the following modules:
**Inventory
**Purchase Orders
**Sales Orders
*:The basic functionality provides one default warehouse, and gives you the ability to configure purchase order processing for regular orders and configure sales order processing with predefined order types.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, all General Ledger accounts that you will use for inventory have been added. For details, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__CON_Chart_of_Accounts|Chart of Accounts].

*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form, all numbering sequences for batches, receipts, issues, adjustments, and physical inventory documents have been added. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Multiple_Numbering_Sequences|Numbering Sequence Usage].
*:((({S:Hint}We recommend that in your production systems, for different types of inventory entries, you specify numbering sequences that differ at least by the prefix in the number. For example, you can use identifiers such as R0000001 for inventory receipts and I0000001 for inventory issues. The reference number of an inventory entry is recorded into the General Ledger transaction that is generated from the entry. When you use unique reference numbers between inventory entries, you can more easily audit the General Ledger transactions.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
An important part of the configuration of the Inventory module is to specify the posting settings—that is, the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts for inventory entities (such as stock items) and the rules determining how the system will select an account in specific transactions. In Acumatica ERP, you can create posting classes and reason codes that provide the default General Ledger accounts and subaccounts, or you can use warehouse- or item-specific accounts and subaccounts. In this topic, you will find information about the types of accounts used in the Inventory module, the system entities for which you can define accounts and subaccounts, and the posting settings.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Posting Settings==
Before you start configuring the Inventory module, you must create all necessary General Ledger accounts and subaccounts that the system will use for inventory transactions. For the description of the accounts and subaccounts used in inventory, see [[#_322e5ef6-efdc-4501-b275-20402435782a|General Ledger Accounts in Inventory].{br}

During the configuration of the Inventory module, you specify the following posting settings:[anchor|#_a955560f-9e2d-48f0-bed9-ad4918177d48]
*Reason codes: Reason codes are used with manually entered inventory transactions to track the reasons for these transactions. Reason codes provide offset accounts (with offset subaccounts if they are used in your system) to be used to post the transactions to General Ledger. For details, see [[#_012fc657-1b5b-4f2b-9d51-aa8a0c199ee4|Reason Codes].
*Posting classes: Posting classes are used to provide default General Ledger accounts and subaccounts for inventory items. For details, see [[#_6fb00522-8970-4d8f-b296-13f2039bafa8|Posting Classes].
*Integration settings between General Ledger and Inventory: The settings used to configure the level of integration between the Inventory and General Ledger modules. For details, see [[#_e4d70d48-be97-4c5d-a1d5-79dd9a9054e7|Inventory–General Ledger Integration Settings].

We recommend that you thoroughly plan inventory accounts during the initial configuration of the Inventory module. But in rare situations you may need to change the accounts after users have started processing inventory documents. For more information, see [[#_f8432eca-f9bd-44a4-a381-4c2f736aa305|Change of an Inventory Account for an Item].[anchor|#_322e5ef6-efdc-4501-b275-20402435782a]
==General Ledger Accounts in Inventory==
In the Inventory module, you can specify General Ledger accounts in settings of the following entities: warehouses (if you use multiple warehouses in the system), posting classes (which can be used for stock or non-stock items), stock items, and non-stock items. You can use the following General Ledger accounts to record inventory transactions:[anchor|#_3626e431-e064-478a-89ff-62e91ee0efb7]
*Inventory/Accrual account: An account that is one of the following:
**An ''asset'' account to keep the inventory balance resulting from transactions with a stock item (if the account is specified for a stock item or for a posting class used for a stock item) or transactions in a specific warehouse (if the account is specified in the warehouse settings). The cost of the items will be debited to the inventory account when the items are received, and credited when the items are issued from inventory.
**A ''liability'' account to be used for non-stock items as the expense accrual account (if the account is specified for a non-stock item or for a posting class to be used for non-stock items). The cost of purchased non-stock items will be credited to this account, and when a bill is created, the cost will be debited to this account.
*Sales account: The income account to record sales for a warehouse, posting class, stock item, or non-stock item.
*COGS/Expense account: An account that is one of the following:
**If the account is specified for a warehouse, stock item, or posting class for stock items, an expense account used as the cost of goods sold (COGS) account. This account will accrue the cost of goods sold once a sales order is released. The cost of items sold is debited to the account when items are issued for sale from inventory.
**If the account is specified for a non-stock item or for a posting class to be used for non-stock items or labor items, this is the expense account used for transactions with these items.
*Standard Cost Variance account: The ''expense'' account to be used for a warehouse, stock item, or posting class for stock items to record any differences between the currently effective standard cost and the cost on the bill for the specified quantities of items. This account is used only for transactions associated with inventory items for which the standard cost valuation method is assigned.
*Standard Cost Revaluation account: The ''expense'' account to be used for a warehouse, stock item, or posting class for stock items to record the differences in inventory value estimated by using the pending standard cost and the currently effective standard cost for the quantities on hand of a stock item. Revaluation is performed at the moment of updating standard costs—that is, when the currently effective standard cost becomes the last standard cost, and the pending cost becomes the effective standard cost. This account is used only for transactions associated with inventory items for which the standard cost valuation method is assigned.
*PO accrual account: The ''liability'' account to be used for a warehouse, stock item, or posting class to accrue amounts on purchase orders related to the warehouse or stock item. Whenever receipts linked to purchase orders are released, the system generates transactions between the purchase order accrual account and the inventory account.
*Purchase Price Variance account: The ''expense'' account to be used for a warehouse, stock item, non-stock item, or posting class for a stock or non-stock item to record any differences between the extended price on the purchase receipt and the extended price on the Accounts Payable bill. This account is used only for transactions associated with inventory items for which any of the valuation methods except for the standard cost valuation method is assigned.
*Landed Cost Variance account: The ''expense'' account to be used for a warehouse, stock item, or posting class for a stock item to record any differences in landed costs between the landed costs amounts specified on purchase receipts and the amounts on inventory receipts.
*Deferral account: The account to be used to hold the deferred amount until it is fully recognized. The account type should be specified as follows: 
**A liability account for a deferral code of the revenue type
**An asset account for a deferral code of the expense type
[anchor|#_012fc657-1b5b-4f2b-9d51-aa8a0c199ee4]
==Reason Codes==
If inventory transactions are generated from the Purchase Orders or Sales Orders module, the system will use the PO Accrual account (for purchase receipts) or the COGS account (for sales orders). The offset account and subaccount for a receipt, issue, adjustment, or transfer are determined by the document&rsquo;s reason code, which is selected depending on the specific transaction being performed. For different types of inventory transactions, different types of offset accounts should be selected. Reason codes also can be used to gather statistics about specific inventory transactions.{br}

You define reason codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form. Each reason code is associated with the type of inventory transaction for which it will be used. For each type of inventory transaction, you can create multiple reason codes, if necessary, to further categorize transactions within their types. By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form, you can define the reason codes used most frequently with each type of transaction as the default reason code for this type of transactions.{br}

For more information on using reason codes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Reason_Codes__Definition_and_Usage|Reason Codes for Inventory].[anchor|#_6fb00522-8970-4d8f-b296-13f2039bafa8]
==Posting Classes==
In Acumatica ERP, you can use posting classes to provide the default accounts and subaccounts for items of the class; in this case, the accounts specified in the posting class are used for assigning the default General Ledger accounts for items. You create posting classes for stock and non-stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you can assign a posting class to an item class; the system will use this posting class as the default posting class for inventory items of this item class. If needed, you can assign a specific posting class (instead of the default one) to a particular stock item by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, and to a particular non-stock item by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. For more information on managing item classes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Classes|Item Classes].{br}

A posting class defines the rules for selecting General Ledger accounts and subaccounts to be used for transactions with items assigned to the posting class. When a transaction with an inventory item is created, multiple similar accounts are involved. For example, when a stock item is received at a particular warehouse, its cost (a debit amount) can be recorded to either the inventory account associated with the warehouse or the inventory account associated with the inventory item. Subaccounts for various types of transactions can be combined from multiple involved subaccounts, depending on the policies established in your organization. You can select General Ledger accounts and subaccount segment values from the following sources:[anchor|#_ecb0992b-8938-4e9d-b6d4-fe28e506955a]
*Inventory item
*Warehouse
*Posting class

The posting class also provides the account and subaccount to be used if the source of General Ledger accounts for a transaction is a posting class itself.{br}

For more details about using posting classes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Posting_Classes__Definition_and_Usage|Posting Classes in Inventory].[anchor|#_e4d70d48-be97-4c5d-a1d5-79dd9a9054e7]
==Inventory–General Ledger Integration Settings==
The settings used to configure the integration between the Inventory and General Ledger modules are located on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. The following check boxes are available: [anchor|#_329ae256-431a-4bc3-8dc4-a9fd85958fac]
*'''Update GL''': If this check box is selected, transactions originating in the Inventory module will update the General Ledger module. If this check box is cleared, inventory transactions do not update the General Ledger module, and the inventory can be maintained independently from the General Ledger module.
*'''Post Summary on Updating GL''': If this check box is selected, the system will include in the batch only summary information (for the account–subaccount pair). If this check box is cleared, the detailed information for each document line will be included in the batch generated for the document.
*'''Automatically Post on Release''': If this check box is cleared, inventory transactions will not be automatically posted to the General Ledger module on release of nventory documents; the inventory transactions should be posted through the General Ledger module. If this check box is selected, inventory transactions will be posted on the release of inventory documents.
[anchor|#_f8432eca-f9bd-44a4-a381-4c2f736aa305]
==Change of an Inventory Account for an Item==
We recommend that you carefully plan inventory accounts and avoid changing the inventory account for an item after you have started processing transactions with the item. ((({S:Hint}If you change the posting class for an item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the General Ledger accounts are repopulated in the item from the new posting class, which may affect the inventory account that is used for transaction processing with the item if the source of the inventory account is set to ''Inventory Item'' for the posting class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form.
)))
If you decide to define a specific inventory account for some item-warehouse combinations, we also recommend that you do this during initial configuration.{br}

If you need to change the inventory account for an item after you have started processing transactions, the following will happen to inventory transactions after you change the inventory account in an item&rsquo;s settings:[anchor|#_b1bf217a-66f8-4ab2-b747-4da71633ad77]
*Inventory receipts, as well as other transactions that increase inventory, will start to process to the new inventory account retrieved from settings.
*Inventory issues will continue to clear the old inventory account until its balance is zero.
*Inventory adjustments will be processed to the new inventory account retrieved from settings.

If you want to transfer the item&rsquo;s balance to the new inventory account, we recommend that you do the following:[anchor|#_0739da8f-7689-4521-94ee-4d6ef8f68a9d]
#You create a temporary clearing asset account in the General Ledger module.
#You create an issue reason code for the old inventory account and a receipt reason code for the new inventory account.
#Keeping the old inventory account in the item settings, you clear the item balance from the old inventory account by doing the following: issue all quantity and cost of the item with the issue reason code that you have defined earlier to clear the balance of the old inventory account, and record the balance to the temporary account.
#You specify the new inventory account in the settings of the item.
#You process a receipt with the item quantity you issued earlier (and at the previously specified cost) with the receipt reason code that you have defined earlier. When you do, the balance is recorded back to the new inventory account and the balance of the temporary account is cleared.
#You make sure the temporary account balance is zero, and deactivate the account on the chart of accounts.

After you have performed these steps, the balance is transferred to the new inventory account, and the item is ready for processing additional inventory transactions.

For details, see        Inventory–General Ledger Integration Settings Inventory–General Ledger Integration Settings. We recommend that you thoroughly plan inventory accounts during the initial configuration of     the Inventory module. But in rare situations you may need to change the accounts after users     have started processing inventory documents. For more information, see  Change of an Inventory Account for an Item Change of an Inventory Account for an Item. General Ledger Accounts in Inventory In the Inventory module, you can specify General Ledger accounts in settings of the following     entities: warehouses (if you use multiple warehouses in the system), posting classes (which can     be used for stock or non-stock items), stock items, and non-stock items. You can use the     following General Ledger accounts to record inventory transactions: Inventory/Accrual account: An account that is one of the following: An  asset  account to keep the inventory balance resulting from transactions with a        stock item (if the account is specified for a stock item or for a posting class used for a        stock item) or transactions in a specific warehouse (if the account is specified in the        warehouse settings). The cost of the items will be debited to the inventory account when the        items are received, and credited when the items are issued from inventory. A  liability  account to be used for non-stock items as the expense accrual account        (if the account is specified for a non-stock item or for a posting class to be used for        non-stock items). The cost of purchased non-stock items will be credited to this account, and        when a bill is created, the cost will be debited to this account. Sales account: The income account to record sales for a warehouse, posting class, stock      item, or non-stock item. COGS/Expense account: An account that is one of the following: If the account is specified for a warehouse, stock item, or posting class for stock items,        an expense account used as the cost of goods sold (COGS) account. This account will accrue        the cost of goods sold once a sales order is released. The cost of items sold is debited to        the account when items are issued for sale from inventory. If the account is specified for a non-stock item or for a posting class to be used for        non-stock items or labor items, this is the expense account used for transactions with these        items. Standard Cost Variance account: The  expense  account to be used for a warehouse, stock      item, or posting class for stock items to record any differences between the currently      effective standard cost and the cost on the bill for the specified quantities of items. This      account is used only for transactions associated with inventory items for which the standard      cost valuation method is assigned. Standard Cost Revaluation account: The  expense  account to be used for a warehouse,      stock item, or posting class for stock items to record the differences in inventory value      estimated by using the pending standard cost and the currently effective standard cost for the      quantities on hand of a stock item. Revaluation is performed at the moment of updating standard      costs—that is, when the currently effective standard cost becomes the last standard cost, and      the pending cost becomes the effective standard cost. This account is used only for      transactions associated with inventory items for which the standard cost valuation method is      assigned. PO accrual account: The  liability  account to be used for a warehouse, stock item, or      posting class to accrue amounts on purchase orders related to the warehouse or stock item.      Whenever receipts linked to purchase orders are released, the system generates transactions      between the purchase order accrual account and the inventory account. Purchase Price Variance account: The  expense  account to be used for a warehouse,      stock item, non-stock item, or posting class for a stock or non-stock item to record any      differences between the extended price on the purchase receipt and the extended price on the      Accounts Payable bill. This account is used only for transactions associated with inventory      items for which any of the valuation methods except for the standard cost valuation method is      assigned. Landed Cost Variance account: The  expense  account to be used for a warehouse, stock      item, or posting class for a stock item to record any differences in landed costs between the      landed costs amounts specified on purchase receipts and the amounts on inventory receipts. Deferral account: The account to be used to hold the deferred amount until it is fully      recognized. The account type should be specified as follows:  A liability account for a deferral code of the revenue type An asset account for a deferral code of the expense type Reason Codes If inventory transactions are generated from the Purchase Orders or Sales Orders module, the     system will use the PO Accrual account (for purchase receipts) or the COGS account (for sales     orders). The offset account and subaccount for a receipt, issue, adjustment, or transfer are     determined by the document's reason code, which is selected depending on the specific     transaction being performed. For different types of inventory transactions, different types of     offset accounts should be selected. Reason codes also can be used to gather statistics about     specific inventory transactions. You define reason codes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) Reason Codes (CS211000) form.     Each reason code is associated with the type of inventory transaction for which it will be used.     For each type of inventory transaction, you can create multiple reason codes, if necessary, to     further categorize transactions within their types. By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences     (IN101000) form, you can define the reason codes used most frequently with each type of     transaction as the default reason code for this type of transactions. For more information on using reason codes, see  Reason Codes for Inventory. Posting Classes In  Acumatica ERP,     you can use posting classes to provide the default accounts and subaccounts for items of the     class; in this case, the accounts specified in the posting class are used for assigning the     default General Ledger accounts for items. You create posting classes for stock and non-stock     items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, you can assign a posting class to an     item class; the system will use this posting class as the default posting class for inventory     items of this item class. If needed, you can assign a specific posting class (instead of the     default one) to a particular stock item by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, and to a particular non-stock item by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. For more information on managing item     classes, see  Item Classes. A posting class defines the rules for selecting General Ledger accounts and subaccounts to be     used for transactions with items assigned to the posting class. When a transaction with an     inventory item is created, multiple similar accounts are involved. For example, when a stock     item is received at a particular warehouse, its cost (a debit amount) can be recorded to either     the inventory account associated with the warehouse or the inventory account associated with the     inventory item. Subaccounts for various types of transactions can be combined from multiple     involved subaccounts, depending on the policies established in your organization. You can select     General Ledger accounts and subaccount segment values from the following sources: Inventory item Warehouse Posting class The posting class also provides the account and subaccount to be used if the source of General     Ledger accounts for a transaction is a posting class itself. For more details about using posting classes, see  Posting Classes in Inventory. Inventory–General Ledger Integration Settings The settings used to configure the integration between the Inventory and General Ledger     modules are located on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. The following check boxes are     available:  Update GL : If this check box is selected, transactions originating in      the Inventory module will update the General Ledger module. If this check box is cleared,      inventory transactions do not update the General Ledger module, and the inventory can be      maintained independently from the General Ledger module. Post Summary on Updating GL : If this check box is selected, the      system will include in the batch only summary information (for the account–subaccount      pair). If this check box is cleared, the detailed information for each document line will be      included in the batch generated for the document. Automatically Post on Release : If this check box is cleared,      inventory transactions will not be automatically posted to the General Ledger module on release      of nventory documents; the inventory transactions should be posted through the General Ledger      module. If this check box is selected, inventory transactions will be posted on the release of      inventory documents. Change of an Inventory Account for an Item We recommend that you carefully plan inventory accounts and avoid changing the inventory     account for an item after you have started processing transactions with the item.  If you change the posting class for an item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items     (IN202500) form, the General Ledger accounts are repopulated in the item from the new posting     class, which may affect the inventory account that is used for transaction processing with the     item if the source of the inventory account is set to  Inventory Item  for the posting     class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes (IN206000) form. If you decide to define a specific inventory account for some item-warehouse combinations, we     also recommend that you do this during initial configuration. If you need to change the inventory account for an item after you have started processing     transactions, the following will happen to inventory transactions after you change the inventory     account in an item's settings: Inventory receipts, as well as other transactions that increase inventory, will start to      process to the new inventory account retrieved from settings. Inventory issues will continue to clear the old inventory account until its balance is      zero. Inventory adjustments will be processed to the new inventory account retrieved from      settings. If you want to transfer the item's balance to the new inventory account, we recommend that you     do the following: You create a temporary clearing asset account in the General Ledger module. You create an issue reason code for the old inventory account and a receipt reason code for      the new inventory account. Keeping the old inventory account in the item settings, you clear the item balance from the      old inventory account by doing the following: issue all quantity and cost of the item with the      issue reason code that you have defined earlier to clear the balance of the old inventory      account, and record the balance to the temporary account. You specify the new inventory account in the settings of the item. You process a receipt with the item quantity you issued earlier (and at the previously      specified cost) with the receipt reason code that you have defined earlier. When you do, the      balance is recorded back to the new inventory account and the balance of the temporary account      is cleared. You make sure the temporary account balance is zero, and deactivate the account on the chart      of accounts. After you have performed these steps, the balance is transferred to the new inventory account,     and the item is ready for processing additional inventory transactions.

The majority of transactions with inventory items are performed when the items are purchased or sold, and respective inventory receipts or issues are generated by other documents, such as purchase receipts and sales orders. Because direct inventory transactions (that is, inventory transactions that are not based on any financial documents) are not standard operations, users should specify why the particular inventory transactions were performed.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the creation and use of reason codes in the Inventory module.{br}{TOC}
==Creation of Reason Codes==
Before you start configuring the settings of the Inventory module, you must create all necessary reason codes to be used in inventory transactions. You define reason codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form. For each reason code, you must specify the following:[anchor|#_16dbe470-3b5a-42f3-8b81-e2bbe2d0ff72]
*Identifier: Identifiers of reason codes may have up to 10 characters and can clearly designate the reason of the transaction, as with ''DAMAGE'', ''EXPIRATION'', ''SHRINKAGE'', and ''RETURNS''.
*Usage: You specify with what inventory transaction a reason code will be used. You can define reason codes for the following types of inventory transactions:
**Receipt
**Issue/return
**Adjustment
**Transfer
**Disassembly
*General Ledger account: You select the General Ledger account that the system will allocate for transactions with this reason code specified. For details, see [[#_7ff58506-70c6-4157-838e-9c6633966432|General Ledger Accounts for Reason Codes].
*General Ledger subaccount and subaccount mask: If you use subaccounts in Acumatica ERP, you specify the subaccount or the subaccount mask (for a combined subaccount) that the system will use for documents with this reason code specified. For details, see [[#_36b78296-f3a3-4949-aaa5-b88bdb24d742|Subaccounts for Reason Codes].
*Sales account and subaccount: If you create a reason code for issues, you optionally specify a sales account and subaccount for use on sales orders. In addition, the sales account from the reason code can override the sales account in the additional sales transaction that can be generated from an inventory issue. If this ''Issue'' reason code is specified in a sales order, it may override the sales and COGS accounts in the transactions that are then generated from the Accounts Receivable invoice and inventory issue.

After you have created all required reason codes, you can specify default reason codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. For details, see [[#_1414824c-da76-46ff-9904-bbc42e55a993|Default Reason Codes for Inventory Transactions].{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_7ff58506-70c6-4157-838e-9c6633966432]
==General Ledger Accounts for Reason Codes==
Each reason code provides an offset account to be used for the transaction. The type of the offset account depends on the type of transaction for which the reason code is used with as well as the reason for the transaction; in most cases, the offset account is a kind of expense account to record specific costs. For example, reason codes defined for issues are used to provide offset accounts for specific types of issues. If an issue is created to remove expired goods, the offset account can be Expired Goods&rsquo; Costs. An inventory return functions similarly to an issue, with the entries reversed.((({S:Hint}For some sales transactions (which do not refer to any specific sales order type), reason codes may provide a sales account and subaccount because sales subaccounts can be generated only in accordance with the rules specified for the order type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form.
)))[anchor|#_36b78296-f3a3-4949-aaa5-b88bdb24d742]
==Subaccounts for Reason Codes==
For each reason code, if subaccounts are used in your system, you specify a subaccount and a subaccount mask (which can be used for a combined subaccount). By specifying a subaccount mask, you configure a rule that the system uses to compose a new subaccount identifier by using the segment values of multiple subaccounts. In a combined subaccount of a reason code, you can use segments from the following sources:[anchor|#_92e436f2-b5e8-4ae7-9a5e-aa4c91fe250c]
*Inventory item (''I''): The subaccount associated with the item
*Warehouse (''W''): The subaccount associated with the warehouse where the transaction is performed
*Posting class (''P''): The subaccount associated with the posting class
*Reason code (''R''): The subaccount associated with the reason code itself

For example, suppose that a two-segmented subaccount identifier with three characters in each segment is defined. To combine the subaccount segments of a warehouse and inventory item, you use the following mask: <tt>WWW-III</tt>, where <tt>WWW</tt> is the first subaccount segment of a warehouse and <tt>III</tt> is the second subaccount segment of an inventory item. To use a subaccount associated with a reason code, you type the following mask: <tt>RRR-RRR</tt>.{br}

For details on how to use combined subaccounts, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__CON_Combined_Subaccounts|Combining Subaccounts].[anchor|#_1414824c-da76-46ff-9904-bbc42e55a993]
==Default Reason Codes for Inventory Transactions==
When an inventory document is created directly in the Inventory module, the reason code defines what account will be used as an offset account and what subaccount will mark the transaction. On release of the transaction, the inventory account (which is copied from the stock item) and the offset account (which is copied from the reason code) will be updated with the amount of the transaction. {br}

For each type of inventory transaction, you can specify the default reason code ton the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. You can assign default reason codes for the following inventory transactions: [anchor|#_66e8af39-269a-4e89-94e7-760ca973fb7b]
*Receipts
*Issues and returns
*Adjustment
*Physical inventory adjustments

When you create one of these inventory documents, the system automatically inserts the specified default reason code for the type. Users can replace the default reason code with another reason code defined for the transaction type, if necessary. ((({S:Hint}You specify the default reason code for vendor returns on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form. For more information on processing vendor returns, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Return_Processing|Purchase Return Processing].

Usage: You specify with what inventory transaction a reason code will be used.                     You can define reason codes for the following types of inventory                         transactions: Receipt Issue/return Adjustment Transfer Disassembly General Ledger account: You select the General Ledger account that the system                     will allocate for transactions with this reason code specified.

General Ledger subaccount and subaccount mask: If you use subaccounts in  Acumatica ERP, you specify the subaccount or the subaccount mask (for a combined                     subaccount) that the system will use for documents with this reason code                     specified. For details, see  Subaccounts for Reason Codes Subaccounts for Reason Codes. Sales account and subaccount: If you create a reason code for issues, you                     optionally specify a sales account and subaccount for use on sales orders. In                     addition, the sales account from the reason code can override the sales account                     in the additional sales transaction that can be generated from an inventory                     issue. If this  Issue  reason code is specified in a sales order, it may                     override the sales and COGS accounts in the transactions that are then generated                     from the Accounts Receivable invoice and inventory issue. After you have created all required reason codes, you can specify default reason                 codes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. For details, see                      Default Reason Codes for Inventory Transactions Default Reason Codes for Inventory Transactions. General Ledger Accounts for Reason Codes Each reason code provides an offset account to be used for the transaction. The type                 of the offset account depends on the type of transaction for which the reason code                 is used with as well as the reason for the transaction; in most cases, the offset                 account is a kind of expense account to record specific costs. For example, reason                 codes defined for issues are used to provide offset accounts for specific types of                 issues. If an issue is created to remove expired goods, the offset account can be                 Expired Goods' Costs. An inventory return functions similarly to an issue, with the                 entries reversed. For some sales transactions (which do not refer to any specific sales                 order type), reason codes may provide a sales account and subaccount because sales                 subaccounts can be generated only in accordance with the rules specified for the                 order type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) Order Types (SO201000)                 form. Subaccounts for Reason Codes For each reason code, if subaccounts are used in your system, you specify a                 subaccount and a subaccount mask (which can be used for a combined subaccount). By                 specifying a subaccount mask, you configure a rule that the system uses to compose a                 new subaccount identifier by using the segment values of multiple subaccounts. In a                 combined subaccount of a reason code, you can use segments from the following                 sources: Inventory item ( I ): The subaccount associated with the item Warehouse ( W ): The subaccount associated with the warehouse where the                     transaction is performed Posting class ( P ): The subaccount associated with the posting class Reason code ( R ): The subaccount associated with the reason code                     itself For example, suppose that a two-segmented subaccount identifier with three characters                 in each segment is defined. To combine the subaccount segments of a warehouse and                 inventory item, you use the following mask:  WWW-III , where                      WWW  is the first subaccount segment of a warehouse and                      III  is the second subaccount segment of an inventory                 item. To use a subaccount associated with a reason code, you type the following                 mask:  RRR-RRR . For details on how to use combined subaccounts, see  Combining Subaccounts. Default Reason Codes for Inventory Transactions When an inventory document is created directly in the Inventory module, the reason                 code defines what account will be used as an offset account and what subaccount will                 mark the transaction. On release of the transaction, the inventory account (which is                 copied from the stock item) and the offset account (which is copied from the reason                 code) will be updated with the amount of the transaction.  For each type of inventory transaction, you can specify the default reason code ton                 the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. You can assign default reason codes for the                 following inventory transactions:  Receipts Issues and returns Adjustment Physical inventory adjustments When you create one of these inventory documents, the system automatically inserts                 the specified default reason code for the type. Users can replace the default reason                 code with another reason code defined for the transaction type, if necessary.                      You specify the default reason code for vendor returns on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences (PO101000) form.

Every inventory transaction creates an appropriate posting to the General Ledger module, depending on the particular inventory item, the type of transaction, the warehouse where the item is stocked, and other conditions. A posting class is a required setting for stock items and defines which accounts and subaccounts should be used to post specific transactions to the General Ledger module. Also, posting classes are used to provide the default General Ledger accounts for stock and non-stock items during the initialization of the system or later, when new stock or non-stock items are being added.{br}

In this topic, you will read about posting classes in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Creation of Posting Classes==
When the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can create posting classes by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form.((({S:Hint}Before you start creating posting classes, make sure that all necessary General Ledger accounts and subaccounts have been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form.
)))
During the creation of a posting class, you specify the following:[anchor|#_44645ab7-e626-4cdc-83bd-4249426b5fc1]
#Class ID: You type a unique identifier that defines the posting class. You can use an alphanumeric string of up to 10 characters as a posting class ID.
#General Ledger accounts and subaccounts: You specify the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts assigned to the posting class. The exact set of accounts and subaccounts you need to select depends on the items for which you create a posting class. For details, see [[#_18ccf0fa-9866-4a9f-a0f7-7eff75735bad|General Ledger Accounts and Subaccounts of a Posting Class].
#Posting settings for transactions: You specify which General Ledger account the system must take for which type of transaction, and the rule the system will use to combine subaccounts. For details, see [[#_d03e51b8-f764-437a-b6b5-f50a8c94a2b9|Posting Settings for General Ledger Accounts] and [[#_e87109ba-976e-4b37-b2d4-5d010ecc0523|Posting Settings for GL Subaccounts].
#Reason code for physical inventory: You specify the reason code that the system will use by default for physical inventory involving items associated with this posting class. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Reason_Codes__Definition_and_Usage|Reason Codes for Inventory].

For a procedure, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Posting_Class|To Create a Posting Class].[anchor|#_18ccf0fa-9866-4a9f-a0f7-7eff75735bad]
==General Ledger Accounts and Subaccounts of a Posting Class==
You specify the default General Ledger accounts and subaccounts assigned to a posting class on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form. These default General Ledger accounts and subaccounts simplify data entry on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) forms. When you assign a posting class to an item class or item, the system copies the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts from the posting class to the item class or item settings.{br}

In the settings of an item class or item, you can override any of the default accounts and subaccounts, if needed.{br}

If you change the posting class for an item class or item, the system updates the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form with the accounts and subaccounts from the new posting class.{br}

For details on General Ledger accounts in inventory, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_GL_Accounts_Inventory|Posting Settings in the Inventory Module].[anchor|#_d03e51b8-f764-437a-b6b5-f50a8c94a2b9]
==Posting Settings for General Ledger Accounts==
General Ledger accounts and subaccounts for inventory transactions related to sales, purchases, and valuation of inventory items can be obtained from multiple sources, depending on the business processes established in your organization. On the '''Posting Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form, for each type of account, you specify from which source the system will take this account for the posting class.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can select General Ledger accounts from the following sources:[anchor|#_02ef8be6-40c5-469b-805f-f754e07d68b8]
*''Inventory item'': The inventory account for all transactions of the item will be the one specified in the item settings regardless of at what warehouse the inventory transaction occurs.
*''Warehouse'': The inventory account will vary depending on the warehouse where the inventory transaction is made. You select this source if you use multiple warehouses in the system and each warehouse has a specific inventory account assigned.
*''Posting class'': The inventory account assigned to the posting class itself (as specified on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] form) will be used. You select this source when you need to replace the inventory account that was previously used for items of the posting class with a new account.
[anchor|#_e041f519-5f47-40fc-a5e8-03f8f2c03315]
==Basic Scenarios of Posting Class Configuration==
When you create posting classes, you can configure the following basic scenarios:[anchor|#_e4a8a151-d9f4-4578-bbd7-35062ab95d9c]
*Posting transactions for multiple items to the same General Ledger account: Suppose that you have a single warehouse, and the majority of inventory transactions should be posted to the same General Ledger account. You do the following:
**You create a posting class and specify for it the inventory account that the system should use for posting inventory transactions.
**You select ''Posting Class'' as the source of the inventory account in the settings of the posting class.
**You specify the created posting class in the settings of each item class or inventory item.
*Posting transactions to item-specific General Ledger accounts: Suppose that you have particularly valuable items for which you want to allocate specific General Ledger accounts. You do the following:
**You specify a separate General Ledger account in the settings of each item class or inventory item that are valuable.
**You create a posting class; in its settings, you select ''Inventory Item'' as the source of the inventory account.
**You specify the created posting class in the settings of the inventory items that have specific General Ledger accounts.
*Posting transactions to warehouse-specific General Ledger accounts: Suppose that you have multiple warehouses and you have separate accounts for each warehouse. You do the following:
**You assign an individual inventory account to each warehouse.
**You create a posting class and select ''Warehouse'' as the source of the inventory account.
**You assign item classes or items to the created posting class.

You can combine basic scenarios to post transactions according to business processes of your organization.[anchor|#_e87109ba-976e-4b37-b2d4-5d010ecc0523]
==Posting Settings for GL Subaccounts==
If the ''Subaccounts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can specify the rules for selecting subaccount segments for inventory transactions that involve items of the posting class. The system can select subaccounts used for transaction posting from the same sources as accounts, but since subaccounts consist of multiple segments, you can combine segment values from different sources to get subaccounts that would reflect all the details of the transaction. For example, if only one inventory account is used in your organization for all inventory items, you might want to provide very specific subaccounts to track which warehouses were involved in every transaction.{br}

On the '''Posting Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form, you can type a subaccount mask that defines how the subaccounts should be composed by using segment values copied from various sources. For each segment, you can select one of the following sources of the segment value:[anchor|#_9d84e026-e754-4580-bd10-ccd74ee08dd9]
*Posting class (''P'')
*Inventory item (''I'')
*Warehouse (''W'')

Consider a simple example of configuring a subaccount mask for a sales subaccount. Suppose there are four segments in the subaccounts used in the system, which have the ''XX-XXX-XX-XX'' format.{br}

If you configure the sales subaccount mask as ''II-III-II-II'', it means that for sales transactions, the sales subaccount from the inventory item will be used.{br}

If you configure the sales subaccount mask as ''WW-PPP-II-PP'', then for sales transactions, the sales subaccount will be a combination of three subaccounts:[anchor|#_98513ca5-26ec-4df8-bb53-6007b2fbc2ba]
*The first segment will be copied from the sales subaccount associated with the warehouse.
*The second and fourth segments will be copied from the sales subaccount associated with the posting class of the item.
*The third segment will be copied from the sales account associated with the inventory item.

For more details on functionality of combined subaccounts, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__CON_Combined_Subaccounts|Combining Subaccounts].

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, you can maintain any number of different units of measure (UOMs) to be used to specify the quantities of products that are purchased, stocked, or sold by your company. In addition, you can specify UOMs of weight and volume to calculate freight costs for third-party carriers. Multiple units of measure are required because items can be sold by the piece or be packed into boxes, packages, crates, and other storage units.{br}

Some units of measure apply to many products and, as such, are defined globally. Other units of measure are used only for particular products or for groups of similar products. In Acumatica ERP, you can define UOMs and conversion rules at all of these levels, as described in the sections below. {br}{TOC}
==Global Units of Measure==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form to define units of measure that can be used globally for all inventory items. You can add new units of measure to the unit conversion reference table on this form and specify how they are converted to units already defined in the table, if applicable. The global UOMs specified in this table can be used throughout Acumatica ERP and are available for selection when a user selects UOMs for a new item class or a base UOM for an item.{br}

You do the following to create an UOM on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] form:[anchor|#_fe12de63-0839-4115-8df9-8025cbde957f]
#In the '''From Unit''' and '''To Unit''' columns, you type the unique identifier of the UOM (such as <tt>KG</tt>).
#In the '''Multiply/Divide''' column, you keep the default value.
#In the '''Conversion Factor''' column, you make sure that the default value, <tt>1.000000</tt>, is specified.

After you create all required UOMs, you can create conversion rules (if necessary) so that the system can calculate prices for items in different UOMs correctly. For more information on conversion rules, see [[#_5b373052-e0d1-414d-86ff-290781b32978|Specification of Conversion Rules] and [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Define_Conversion_Rule_for_UOM|To Define a Conversion Rule for UOMs].{br}

In addition to global UOMs, you can create item-specific UOMs on the fly when you are creating an item class or inventory item. For details, see [[#_5ae07ce8-bb7a-40f6-b083-a9611bca74a9|Default UOMs for Item Classes] and [[#_05db3ae4-d4e4-4a4f-8f78-449c51e0d3bb|Item-Specific UOMs].
==UOMs of Weight and Volume==
If your company uses third-party carriers to deliver sold goods to customers or purchases from vendors, you may need to define UOMs of weight and volume to calculate specific freight amounts. After you have created all required UOMs and conversion rules on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form, you can specify global UOMs for weight and volume on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form. The system will use these UOMs to calculate freight costs.{br}

You can specify weight and volume UOMs for each stock and non-stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) forms, respectively. UOMs specified on these forms have a higher priority than global UOMs specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] form.{br}

For information on UOMs used to measure the weight and volume of the items listed on sales orders and purchase receipts, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_BaseWeightVolumeUOMs|Units of Weight and Volume].[anchor|#_5ae07ce8-bb7a-40f6-b083-a9611bca74a9]
==Default UOMs for Item Classes==
If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, for each item class that is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you can specify the following units to be used by default for items of the class:[anchor|#ul_j3p_zvz_sh]
*'''Base Unit''': The unit of measure used to calculate unit costs for items of the class. For stock items, this unit is used for maintaining availability data. Users count the quantities of each stock item at warehouses by using the UOM specified as the base unit for the item. For recommendations on selecting base units, see [[#_6bd9895c-ec51-455b-9f8f-a127161d17ce|Base Unit Selection].
*'''Sales Unit''': The unit of measure typically used when your company sells the item.
*'''Purchase Unit''': The unit of measure typically used when your company purchases the item.

If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is not enabled in your system, you can specify only base units for item classes as well as for individual stock and non-stock items. ((({S:Hint}If you decide later to enable the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature, the sales and purchase units for each item class (as well as for each stock and non-stock item) will be assigned the values from the appropriate base units.
))){br}

You can select globally defined units of measure or type a class-specific UOM. Once you have typed a new UOM, a new line with this UOM is added to the conversion tables automatically, so that you can specify how this UOM is converted to the base unit of the class. For detailed instructions, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Define_UOM|To Create an UOM].((({S:Hint}The system will not automatically add class-specific units to the global unit conversion reference table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] form.
))){br}

The base, sales, and purchase UOMs selected for the class will provide the default values of these settings for items of this class.[anchor|#_05db3ae4-d4e4-4a4f-8f78-449c51e0d3bb]
==Item-Specific UOMs==
For particular items of the class, on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, you can select the base, sales, and purchase units. (Boxes for sales and purchase UOMs are displayed only if the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.) By default, the system assigns the base, sales, and purchase units of the class to the item. If you need to specify other UOMs, you can select UOMs from the list of globally defined UOMs or type new units. The system will automatically add the new item-specific UOMs to the table of units conversion on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form— that is, to the list of globally defined UOMs.((({S:Warn}If you need to change the item&rsquo;s base UOM (or the sales or purchase UOM, if applicable), make sure that the rules for conversion between the current and new UOMs are specified before you use the item with any new UOM in any new transaction.
)))
When you enter a transaction and specify the quantity of the inventory item and its unit of measure, the system converts the specified UOM to the base unit for cost-of-sold-goods calculation and to the default sales unit for finding the proper price (or the item&rsquo;s other unit for which the price can be found).
==Cross-Reference Units of Measure==
Stock or non-stock items may have alternate IDs specified on the '''Cross-References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. You can assign these items UOMs other than the default sales and purchase units of measure to be used when users enter documents with lines in which they enter these alternate IDs. For detailed information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Cross-References#_119e97a3-c747-4cea-a699-ef56e2ead6b5|Using Cross-Reference Units of Measure] in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Cross-References|Item Cross-References].[anchor|#_6bd9895c-ec51-455b-9f8f-a127161d17ce]
==Base Unit Selection==
You may want to select for each item a base unit that is the smallest unit you would ever use when buying or selling the product, so you can avoid any problems caused by rounding. To understand this guideline, consider an example: Suppose that you purchase and stock a product (canned juice) in boxes of 12 cans, and you select a box as the base unit for this product. If you then decided to sell the product by cans, you would need to specify quantities in fractions or define the sales unit (if sales and purchase units are enabled in your system) as 0.0833333 (one-twelfth) of the base unit.{br}

Further imagine that one customer wants to buy 5 cans and another wants to buy another 5 cans. In both cases, the sales order would specify 0.417 units (5 &#42; 0.0833333), and each customer would get 5 cans. However, the remaining 0.166 units don&rsquo;t actually equate to the 2 cans left in the box. During a financial period, in a warehouse, these rounding problems could cause a significant discrepancy between the quantities on books and the physical quantities.{br}

During physical inventory, counting is performed in base units, so if the base unit for the product is not the smallest UOM applicable to the item, counting results may prove incorrect. Considering the above example, counting only boxes can result in incorrect total number of cans because some of the boxes may not be full. Thus, we recommend using a base unit that is the smallest unit your company uses when buying and selling the product.[anchor|#_5b373052-e0d1-414d-86ff-290781b32978]
==Specification of Conversion Rules==
When you define conversion rules for UOMs, make sure that the decimal precision specified in the '''Quantity Decimal Places''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form does not cut off any meaningful digits.{br}

If different UOMs are used as base, sales, and purchase units, you specify conversion rules with respect to the UOM selected as the base unit for the item. For instance, suppose an item is sold to customers by the piece (''PIECE''), making ''PIECE'' its sales unit. The product is stocked in boxes, and each box (''BOX'') includes 16 pieces. The product is purchased from a vendor in containers. Each container (''CONTAINER'') contains 20 boxes, and the purchase unit is ''CONTAINER''. As the base unit, you can select ''PIECE'' or ''BOX''. (The smallest unit is usually selected, for reasons described in the previous section.) If you selected ''PIECE'', you would specify the following conversion rules.[anchor|#table_e33_v35_tv]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! From Unit
!width="25%" ! Multiply/Divide
!width="25%" ! Conversion Factor
!width="25%" ! To Unit 
|- 
| ''CONTAINER''
|  ''Multiply''
| <tt>320</tt>
| ''PIECE''
|- 
|  ''BOX''
|  ''Multiply''
| <tt>16</tt>
| ''PIECE''
|}
Notice that the specified conversion rules are not reversible—the system cannot use the rule in the first row of the above table to recalculate the quantity specified in pieces to the quantity specified in containers.{br}

Also, any conversion should be specified directly with respect to the base UOM, and it would be impossible to convert any quantity specified in containers to the quantity specified in boxes if you specify the rules as follows.[anchor|#table_dtm_dn5_tv]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! From Unit
!width="25%" ! Multiply/Divide
!width="25%" ! Conversion Factor
!width="25%" ! To Unit 
|- 
| ''CONTAINER''
|  ''Multiply''
| <tt>20</tt>
| '' BOX''
|- 
|  ''BOX''
|  ''Multiply''
| <tt>16</tt>
| ''PIECE''
|}
If you decide to use ''BOX'' as the base unit, you must define the rules differently, as follows.[anchor|#table_yxn_dj5_tv]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! From Unit
!width="25%" ! Multiply/Divide
!width="25%" ! Conversion Factor
!width="25%" ! To Unit 
|- 
| ''CONTAINER''
|  ''Multiply''
| <tt>20</tt>
| ''BOX''
|- 
|  ''PIECE''
|  ''Divide''
| <tt>16</tt>
| ''BOX''
|}

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Units of Measure and 		 Conversions In  Acumatica ERP, you can maintain any number of different units of measure (UOMs) to be used to 				specify the quantities of products that are purchased, stocked, or sold by your 				company. In addition, you can specify UOMs of weight and volume to calculate freight 				costs for third-party carriers. Multiple units of measure are required because items 				can be sold by the piece or be packed into boxes, packages, crates, and other 				storage units. Some units of measure apply to many products and, as such, are defined globally. Other units 				of measure are used only for particular products or for groups of similar products. 				In  Acumatica ERP, you can define UOMs and conversion rules at all of these levels, as described in 				the sections below.  Global Units of Measure You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form to 				define units of measure that can be used globally for all inventory items. You can 				add new units of measure to the unit conversion reference table on this form and 				specify how they are converted to units already defined in the table, if applicable. 				The global UOMs specified in this table can be used throughout  Acumatica ERP and are available for selection when a user selects UOMs for a new item class or 				a base UOM for an item. You do the following to create an UOM on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure form: In the  From Unit  and  To Unit  columns, you type 					the unique identifier of the UOM (such as  KG ). In the  Multiply/Divide  column, you keep the default value. In the  Conversion Factor  column, you make sure that the default 					value,  1.000000 , is specified. After you create all required UOMs, you can create conversion rules (if necessary) so that the 				system can calculate prices for items in different UOMs correctly. For more 				information on conversion rules, see  Specification of Conversion Rules Specification of Conversion Rules and  To Define a Conversion Rule for UOMs. In addition to global UOMs, you can create item-specific UOMs on the fly when you are 				creating an item class or inventory item. For details, see  Default UOMs for Item Classes Default UOMs for Item Classes and  Item-Specific UOMs Item-Specific UOMs. UOMs of Weight and Volume If your company uses third-party carriers to deliver sold goods to customers or purchases from 				vendors, you may need to define UOMs of weight and volume to calculate specific 				freight amounts. After you have created all required UOMs and conversion rules on 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form, you can 				specify global UOMs for weight and volume on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies 				(CS101500) form. The system will use these UOMs to calculate freight costs. You can specify weight and volume UOMs for each stock and non-stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items 				(IN202000) forms, respectively. UOMs specified on these forms have a higher priority 				than global UOMs specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies form. For information on UOMs used to measure the weight and volume of the items listed on sales 				orders and purchase receipts, see  Units of Weight and Volume. Default UOMs for Item Classes If the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, for each item class that is 				defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, you 				can specify the following units to be used by default for items of the class: Base Unit : The unit of measure used to calculate unit costs for items 					of the class. For stock items, this unit is used for maintaining availability 					data. Users count the quantities of each stock item at warehouses by using the 					UOM specified as the base unit for the item. For recommendations on selecting 					base units, see  Base Unit Selection Base Unit Selection. Sales Unit : The unit of measure typically used when your company 					sells the item. Purchase Unit : The unit of measure typically used when your company 					purchases the item. If the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is not enabled in your system, you can specify 				only base units for item classes as well as for individual stock and non-stock 				items.  If you decide later to enable the  Multiple Units of Measure  					feature, the sales and purchase units for each item class (as well as for each 					stock and non-stock item) will be assigned the values from the appropriate base 					units. You can select globally defined units of measure or type a class-specific UOM. Once 				you have typed a new UOM, a new line with this UOM is added to the conversion tables 				automatically, so that you can specify how this UOM is converted to the base unit of 				the class. For detailed instructions, see  To Create an UOM. The system will not automatically add class-specific units to the 					global unit conversion reference table on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure 					form. The base, sales, and purchase UOMs selected for the class will provide the default values of 				these settings for items of this class. Item-Specific UOMs For particular items of the class, on the  General Settings  tab of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, you can select the 				base, sales, and purchase units. (Boxes for sales and purchase UOMs are displayed 				only if the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.) By default, the system assigns the 				base, sales, and purchase units of the class to the item. If you need to specify 				other UOMs, you can select UOMs from the list of globally defined UOMs or type new 				units. The system will automatically add the new item-specific UOMs to the table of 				units conversion on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) 				form— that is, to the list of globally defined UOMs. If you need to change the item's base UOM (or the sales or purchase UOM, if 				applicable), make sure that the rules for conversion between the current and new 				UOMs are specified before you use the item with any new UOM in any new 				transaction. When you enter a transaction and specify the quantity of the inventory item and its unit of 				measure, the system converts the specified UOM to the base unit for 				cost-of-sold-goods calculation and to the default sales unit for finding the proper 				price (or the item's other unit for which the price can be found). Cross-Reference Units of Measure Stock or non-stock items may have alternate IDs specified on the 					 Cross-References  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. You can assign 				these items UOMs other than the default sales and purchase units of measure to be 				used when users enter documents with lines in which they enter these alternate IDs. 				For detailed information, see  Using Cross-Reference Units of Measure in  Item Cross-References. Base Unit Selection You may want to select for each item a base unit that is the smallest unit you would ever use 				when buying or selling the product, so you can avoid any problems caused by 				rounding. To understand this guideline, consider an example: Suppose that you 				purchase and stock a product (canned juice) in boxes of 12 cans, and you select a 				box as the base unit for this product. If you then decided to sell the product by 				cans, you would need to specify quantities in fractions or define the sales unit (if 				sales and purchase units are enabled in your system) as 0.0833333 (one-twelfth) of 				the base unit. Further imagine that one customer wants to buy 5 cans and another wants to buy another 5 cans. 				In both cases, the sales order would specify 0.417 units (5 * 0.0833333), and each 				customer would get 5 cans. However, the remaining 0.166 units don't actually equate 				to the 2 cans left in the box. During a financial period, in a warehouse, these 				rounding problems could cause a significant discrepancy between the quantities on 				books and the physical quantities.

Thus, we 				recommend using a base unit that is the smallest unit your company uses when buying 				and selling the product. Specification of Conversion Rules When you define conversion rules for UOMs, make sure that the decimal precision specified in 				the  Quantity Decimal Places  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form does not cut off any meaningful 				digits.

If you selected  PIECE , you would specify the following 				conversion rules.

When a carrier is used to deliver products from your organization to a customer, the carrier can charge your company specific freight amounts that depend on the weights or volumes of the packages in shipments. The carrier may also set restrictions on the weight or volume of packages. Landed costs incurred for shipments delivered from vendors to your company can be calculated by the weight or volume of the items in the shipment.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can select the base units of measure (UOMs) for weight and volume and set up the automatic calculation of weights and volumes for sales and purchase orders. In this topic, you will read about weight and volume UOMs.{br}{TOC}
==The Base Weight and Volume UOMs==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form to specify the base UOMs for weight and volume.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form, you should first create a unit of measure (UOM) to be used in your system as the base UOM for weight. The weights of all sales and purchase orders will be calculated in this UOM. However, if the items differ in weight significantly, you can create other UOMs for measuring the weights of the base units of stock and non-stock items. For each additional weight UOM, you must specify the rules for converting this UOM to the base weight UOM. {br}

For example, suppose that you need to create weight UOMs for a gram (''GRAM'') and pound (''LB'') and define conversion rules to convert the weights measured in pounds to weights measured in grams and to convert the weights measured in grams to weights measured in pounds. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] form, you would do the following:[anchor|#_a5ab2ac2-b52c-47ce-9003-5f196a10952f]
#Create the <tt>GRAM</tt> UOM for grams.
#Create the <tt>LB</tt> UOM for pounds.
#Create a conversion rule from grams to pounds with the ''Multiply'' conversion type and <tt>453.5923</tt> conversion factor
#Create a conversion rules from pounds to grams with the ''Multiply'' conversion type and <tt>0.0022046</tt> conversion factor
#:((({S:Hint}Here you specify the conversion factor as 0.0022046 with 7 decimal places. This value shows how many pounds one gram contains. In your system, the decimal precision is defined in the '''Quantity Decimal Places''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form. Make sure that the selected decimal precision does not cut off any meaningful digits. For instance, if you set the number of decimal places for quantities to 2, this would result in incorrect conversions from grams to pounds.
)))

For a general procedure that describes how to create UOMs and conversion rules, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Define_UOM|To Create an UOM].{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] form, you should define a UOM that will be used in your system to measure the volume of specific quantities of the items listed on sales and purchase orders. You should also define all other UOMs that may be used to measure the volumes that the base units of various items can take and specify the conversion factors with respect to the base volume UOM.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form, select the base weight UOM in the '''Weight UOM''' box and select the base volume UOM in the '''Volume UOM''' box.
==Weight and Volume of Stock Items==
For each stock item, you can specify the weight and the volume (measured in a specific volume UOM) of its base unit on the '''Packaging''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. For non-stock items, you can specify these values (if applicable) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.{br}

For the item-specific weight and volume UOMs, you must specify rules for conversion to the appropriate base UOMs either on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form or on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form.{br}

If the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, make sure that rules for converting each sales and purchase unit to the base UOM selected for the item are defined in the system. Also, if the '''Use a Price Adjustment Multiplier''' check box is selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form, you can specify a price adjustment multiplier for the item. For more information on adjusting prices, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Units_of_Measure_and_Conversions|Units of Measure and Conversions].
==Weight and Volume Calculation for Purchase Receipts==
The system can calculate the weight and volume of the received quantities of stock and non-stock items for each purchase receipt.{br}

The landed cost specified for each purchase receipt can be split among the items listed in the receipt in proportion to the item weights or volumes (among other options). For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Landed_Cost_Tracking|Processing Landed Cost Documents].

On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form, you should first create a unit of         measure (UOM) to be used in your system as the base UOM for weight. The weights of all sales         and purchase orders will be calculated in this UOM. However, if the items differ in weight         significantly, you can create other UOMs for measuring the weights of the base units of         stock and non-stock items. For each additional weight UOM, you must specify the rules for         converting this UOM to the base weight UOM.  For example, suppose that you need to create weight UOMs for a gram ( GRAM ) and pound           ( LB ) and define conversion rules to convert the weights measured in pounds to         weights measured in grams and to convert the weights measured in grams to weights measured         in pounds. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure form, you would do the following: Create the  GRAM  UOM for grams. Create the  LB  UOM for pounds. Create a conversion rule from grams to pounds with the  Multiply  conversion type           and  453.5923  conversion factor Create a conversion rules from pounds to grams with the  Multiply  conversion type           and  0.0022046  conversion factor Here you specify the             conversion factor as 0.0022046 with 7 decimal places. This value shows how many pounds             one gram contains. In your system, the decimal precision is defined in the                Quantity Decimal Places  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form. Make sure that the selected decimal             precision does not cut off any meaningful digits. For instance, if you set the number of             decimal places for quantities to 2, this would result in incorrect conversions from             grams to pounds. For a general procedure that describes how to create UOMs and conversion rules, see  To Create an UOM.

You should also define all other UOMs that may be used to measure the         volumes that the base units of various items can take and specify the conversion factors         with respect to the base volume UOM. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form, select the base weight UOM in the            Weight UOM  box and select the base volume UOM in the            Volume UOM  box. Weight and Volume of Stock Items For each stock item, you can specify the weight and the volume (measured in a specific volume         UOM) of its base unit on the  Packaging  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. For non-stock items, you can specify these         values (if applicable) by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. For the item-specific weight and volume UOMs, you must specify rules for conversion to the         appropriate base UOMs either on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form or on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) Units of Measure (CS203100) form. If the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form, make sure that rules for converting each sales         and purchase unit to the base UOM selected for the item are defined in the system. Also, if         the  Use a Price Adjustment Multiplier  check box is selected on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences         (SO101000) form, you can specify a price adjustment multiplier for the item. For more         information on adjusting prices, see  Units of Measure and Conversions. Weight and Volume Calculation for Purchase Receipts The system can calculate the weight and volume of the received quantities of stock and     non-stock items for each purchase receipt. The landed cost specified for each purchase receipt can be split among the items listed in the         receipt in proportion to the item weights or volumes (among other options). For more         information, see  Processing Landed Cost Documents.  ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
Many businesses consider inventory to be an important asset. Inventory includes ''stock items'': the finished goods and raw materials that cost money, have value, and are stored. Along with stock items, businesses may sell ''non-stock items'': usually non-physical goods, such as services and warranties, that are not stocked. Stock and non-stock items, which are processed differently in Acumatica ERP, are both referred to as ''inventory items''.{br}

For each inventory item, you create a record in the database that provides information about the type of the item, its identifier, its description, the General Ledger accounts allocated for the item, its price and cost information, the various units of measure (UOMs) that apply to it, and the conversions between UOMs. The records for stock items contain additional information required to track the items in the system.{br}

This topic highlights general information about inventory items, the major differences between stock and non-stock items, and the processing of inventory items in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_38038e84-0869-4440-b1d5-5f91ce3f2719]
==Inventory IDs==
Each inventory item is tracked in the system by its inventory ID. This unique identifier can be just a number, or you can configure it to provide basic information about the item type, brand, or use. Inventory IDs can be designed to help you sort and group items for reports. {br}

As with other identifiers in Acumatica ERP, inventory IDs can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. Identifiers for stock and non-stock items are configured by using the same segmented key: ''INVENTORY''. For the key, you can define how many segments it will have, what values may be used, whether they should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used for generating inventory IDs. To have inventory IDs automatically generated on creating new inventory items, you can configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key as having a single segment with the '''Auto-Number''' option selected for this segment and a numbering sequence specified in the '''Numbering ID''' box. {br}

If users will enter inventory IDs manually, you can configure the ''INVENTORY'' key as having a single segment with non-validated values. If the type of items should be indicated by their IDs, consider configuring the ''INVENTORY'' key with two segments and creating a list of predefined values for one of the segments. For details on segmented keys, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].{br}

When configuring the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key, decide whether you will use alternate IDs for stock and non-stock items. If you enter alternate IDs (item identifiers used by the vendors and customer of the items), users will be able to specify items by typing their alternate IDs as well as inventory IDs in the '''Inventory ID''' boxes on sales and purchase orders without the system generating errors. For more information on using alternate IDs and on how to configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key in this case, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Cross-References|Item Cross-References].{br}

If required, you can change the inventory ID for any non-stock or stock item manually by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Change ID''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, respectively, and by specifying the new inventory ID in the dialog box that opens.{br}

Your company might want to use ''subitems'' to further categorize otherwise-identical stock items with properties such as colors or sizes that are important to customers. Thus, under the same inventory ID, you may have a number of subitems—products that share all the settings of the inventory item&rsquo;s record but have additional properties that differ. If your company has decided to use subitems, all stock items will be identified by a combination of inventory ID and subitem code. For more details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_IDs_and_Subitem_Codes|Inventory Subitems].
==Stock Items==
If the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can create stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Stock items are usually physical goods that you purchase or manufacture and sell to your customers. Examples of stock items include computers, cell phones, cables, and auto parts. Stock items may have lot or serial numbers that you can use to track the items in your system.{br}

You can create a stock item of any of the following types: ''Finished Good'', ''Component Part'', or ''Subassembly''. The type of a stock item is intended for informational purposes and does not affect processing.{br}

The system automatically tracks stock items and maintains availability data. You can track stock items by their cost value.{br}

For more information on stock items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Stock_Items|Stock Items].
==Non-Stock Items==
Non-stock items are typically non-physical goods (such as labor, services, or warranties), or items with very low values that might be hard to track. Examples might include labor and repair charges, warranties, and small repair or installation parts.{br}

You enter each non-stock item on the (IN202000) form and specify one of the following types: ''Non-Stock Item'', ''Labor'', ''Service'', ''Charge'', or ''Expense''.{br}

Available quantities of non-stock items are not tracked by the system; they are treated as if they are available in any quantity at any time. A line on a sales order that features a non-stock item cannot be back ordered.{br}

For more information on non-stock items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Non-Stock_Item_Support|Non-Stock Items in the Inventory Module]. 
==Posting Classes for Item Classes and Inventory Items==
Posting classes facilitate specifying General Ledger accounts for multiple new inventory items assigned to specific item classes. Each item class has a posting class assigned. When a user creates a new stock item by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the item is assigned to an item class and, hence, to a specific posting class. If necessary, the user can select another posting class for the item.{br}

Once the posting class is selected, the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts for the item on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form will be filled in based on the accounts and subaccounts specified on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the posting class (the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] form). When you create new non-stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, posting classes are also used to provide the default accounts and subaccounts for these items.{br}

For more information about posting classes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Posting_Classes__Definition_and_Usage|Posting Classes in Inventory].

Some of these default values can be overridden for individual items, if needed. The item class is a required setting for a stock item.{br}

For details about how to create an item class, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Item_Class|To Create an Item Class].{br}

In this topic, you will read about item classes in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Item Class Settings==
Each item class can specify the following:[anchor|#_65212b60-1b91-4af1-b2da-e30cd724a24a]
*Whether the class groups stock items, for which the system generates inventory transactions, or non-stock items, which is not tracked in inventory.
*The default settings that the item class provides to items of the class and that you can change later by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form. For details, see [[#_9e658006-b406-451d-bed2-ad6ea6d0aca4|Default Settings for Inventory Items].
*The availability calculation rule that applies to the items of the item class that groups stock items. For details, see [[#_e3f04e17-91c0-4160-a1be-25b242edf1bf|Availability Calculation Rules in an Item Class].
*The hierarchy of item classes. For details, see [[#_532af870-0e27-493b-b357-517cac9257fa|Hierarchy of Item Classes].
*The method of demand calculation for replenishment of items that are grouped by the item class. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Automated_Replenishment|Automated Replenishment].
*The configuration of custom attributes that items might have, such as color and size. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Item_Attributes|Inventory Item Attributes].

You can specify default item classes in the '''Default Stock Item Class''' and '''Default Non-Stock Item Class''' boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. The system will copy the settings of the default item class to newly created stock and non-stock item classes.[anchor|#_9e658006-b406-451d-bed2-ad6ea6d0aca4]
==Default Settings for Inventory Items==
The default settings that an item class provides to inventory items are the following:[anchor|#_99dba38b-2c3c-4943-a520-f4600d13ea2a]
*Item type (these types are different for stock and non-stock items)
*Valuation method
*Tax category
*Posting class
*Lot or serial number
*Default warehouse
*Units of measure
*Custom attributes
*Replenishment class

You can plan item classes so that they aggregate as much information as possible about the groups of similar inventory items, including the posting classes. After you configure the item classes in this way, you will have to specify a minimum of information for individual inventory items during manual data entry or import—for example, only '''Inventory ID''', '''Description''', and '''Item Class'''—while the rest of the information will be automatically populated based on the selected item class.[anchor|#_e3f04e17-91c0-4160-a1be-25b242edf1bf]
==Availability Calculation Rules in an Item Class==
The system tracks the on-hand quantity of items in inventory and calculates the available quantity of items, which can be used for inventory planning and replenishment. You might want to include anticipated goods in the available quantity, which you can specify in the availability calculation settings. The availability calculation rule is defined at the item class level and cannot be changed for particular items. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Availability_Calculation|Availability Calculation].[anchor|#_532af870-0e27-493b-b357-517cac9257fa]
==Hierarchy of Item Classes==
You can configure the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key so that it has multiple segments, each denoting a level of item class hierarchy. Then you can define the hierarchy of item classes and use item classes for categorizing items.{br}

To use item classes for categorizing items, you can set the hierarchy of the item classes directly in the item class IDs. For example, suppose that your organization sells electronics and computers. You can create an item class for computers and include child item classes for laptops, monitors, and keyboards in this item class. Similarly, you can create an item class for electronics with item classes for audio players, speakers, and headphones included. For details on hierarchical item classes, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Hierarchy_of_Item_Classes|Hierarchy of Item Classes ].

In Acumatica ERP, stock items are usually physical goods (such as computers, cell phones, cables, and auto parts) that you purchase or manufacture and sell to your customers. Stock items may have lot or serial numbers you can use to track the items in your system. You can create stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form only if the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

In this topic, you can find information about stock items in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Stock Items==
You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form to create stock items in the system. You must create a stock item for each good that you purchase or sell and that you want to track in the Inventory module. To create a stock item, you do the following:[anchor|#_dc7196d4-851c-41c7-877a-7575b5248702]
#You type a unique inventory ID for the item. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Items#_38038e84-0869-4440-b1d5-5f91ce3f2719|Inventory IDs] in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Items|Inventory Items].
#You select one of the existing item classes, which will provide default settings to the item, such as item type, valuation method, tax category, posting class, default warehouse, availability calculation rules, units of measure and replenishment settings. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Classes|Item Classes].
#Optional: You change any of the settings provided by the selected item class as needed.
#Optional: If you use multiple warehouse locations, you select locations for issue and receipt for the stock item you are configuring. For more information on warehouse locations, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Warehouse_Locations|Warehouse Locations].
#Optional: If you use third-party carriers to deliver the stock item, you specify the weight or volume of the item and select a packaging option. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_Automated_Shipments|Automatic Packaging for Integrated Carriers].

For details about how to create a stock item, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Stock_Item|To Create a Stock Item].
==Types of Stock Items==
You select one of the following stock item types, which are used for informational purposes only and designate the inventories that a company may have, for each stock item:[anchor|#ul_kxz_55f_wr]
*''Finished Good'': You use this type for finished goods that you sell to customers.
*''Component Part'': You can use this type for component items from which intermediate assemblies and finished goods are produced during kit assembly processes.
*''Subassembly'': You can use this type for intermediate assemblies from which finished goods are produced during kit assembly processes.

==Transactions with Stock Items==
After you have created stock items in the system and configured their settings, you can start processing transactions. Unlike with non-stock items, transactions with stock items need to be processed starting from the forms of the Purchase Orders or Sales Orders module, such as [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. From these modules, the system generates the proper inventory transactions and the corresponding Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable documents.{br}

Stock items cannot be manually selected in Accounts Receivable invoices. In Accounts Payable bills, you can select stock items; however, the Accounts Payable documents can be released only after all lines with stock items are linked to the corresponding lines of the purchase receipts that have been released in the Purchase Orders module.((({S:Hint}You cannot delete a stock item in the system if there are any completed transactions with the item, any unreleased documents that includes this item, or any nonzero quantity of the item at any warehouse location.
)))
==Stock Item Tracking==
The system automatically tracks stock items and maintains availability data: how many base units are on hand, how many are ordered from vendors, and how many are booked to sales orders and shipments. You can configure how exactly the availability data is computed, and the data is updated as the item is received, invoiced, adjusted, or transferred. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Availability_Calculation|Availability Calculation].{br}

Stock items are also tracked by their cost value. Various valuation methods are available for tracking item costs (for details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods]). Typically, a stock item is an asset until it is sold. Its cost becomes an expense.{br}

The system also automatically monitors when the stock level of the item falls below the defined minimum and automatically calculates the quantities required to replenish the stock, based on the demand for the item and the inventory information you have defined for the stock item. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Automated_Replenishment|Automated Replenishment].

Non-stock items, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, may be "products" that are not physical entities and thus cannot be stocked in warehouses. Many organizations sell items that can’t be found on their shelves, such as product warranties, or services such as product assembly, installation, or customization.{br}

Whereas some items are obviously non-stock, such as labor rates and services, other items that are physical entities (such as gift-wrapping) can be either stock or non-stock. The decision about whether to consider physical entities stock or non-stock depends on the company&rsquo;s inventory policies and other conditions.{br}

In the system, non-stock items are handled differently from stock items that are kept in warehouses (and tracked accordingly). For stock items, the system maintains all cost, quantity, sales, and cost-of-goods-sold information. Because non-stock items do not require the tracking of quantities, the system maintains only standard costs and base price information for them.((({S:Hint}If the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features is not included in your Acumatica ERP license, you will be able to create non-stock items and use them in the Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable documents. However, you will not be able to define posting classes for them or to update their prices and costs in bulk. 
If the ''Inventory and Order Management'' group of features is enabled but the ''Inventory'' feature is not enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can still use non-stock items in sales orders, purchase orders, and purchase requisitions with some limitations. (Some elements you use for non-stock items, such as the '''Require Receipt''' and '''Require Shipment''' boxes, are unavailable. For more information about settings that depend on this feature, see the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form reference.)
))){br}{TOC}
==Types of Non-Stock Items==
 Acumatica ERP supports the following types of non-stock items, one of which can be selected in the '''Type''' box of the '''General Settings '''tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form: 
*''Non-Stock Item'': A general type of a non-stock item. You can use it for any unspecific type of non-physical items or for physical items that you don&rsquo;t need to register in inventory.
*''Labor'' or ''Labor Item'': A non-stock item mostly used as a source of General Ledger accounts for recording sales of labor.
*''Service'': A non-stock item to designate service fees.
*''Charge'': A non-stock item that represents charges of a specific type.
*''Expense'': A non-stock item that represents expenses of a specific type.

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you can create item classes for non-stock items to provide default settings for each type of non-stock item used in your business. With these classes defined, users can specify an item class when they use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form to define a new non-stock item, and the system fills in common values, thus saving time and increasing accuracy.
==Settings for Non-Stock Items==
Information about non-stock items and their properties is maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, which is available in the Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, and Inventory modules. The list below describes some of the settings you can provide for a non-stock item by using this form: 
*Inventory ID: Every non-stock item is assigned an unique identifier based on the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key. For details on the ways the identifier can be configured, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_Items|Inventory Items]. For material non-stock items, you can specify a default warehouse and specify whether the items require shipping and receipts on purchase. 
*:((({S:Hint}If subitems are used in your system, they do not apply to non-stock items. 
)))
*Units of measure and conversion rules: For each non-stock item, you can select the units of measure (UOMs) used as base, sales, and purchase units for the item and specify conversion rules for them and for other UOMs used for the item. You can select UOMs from the list of those available for the item class or enter new UOMs on the fly. Every conversion rule is specified with respect to the UOM selected as the item&rsquo;s base unit.
*Packaging options: If the non-stock item requires shipping, specify the weight of the base unit and the UOM used to measure the weight.
*General Ledger accounts and subaccounts (if subaccounts are applicable in your system): Purchases and sales of non-stock items do not affect companies&rsquo; assets, so the General Ledger accounts and subaccounts used for non-stock items are limited to sales accounts, expense accounts, and accounts required for posting transactions related to kit assembly if the item is a kit or a kit component. You can use subaccounts to detail records within each account. 
*:((({S:Hint}If a receipt is required for a non-stock item, a price variance account and a purchase accrual account must be specified to record purchases of this non-stock item. When the receipt is matched to the invoice, any price variance for the non-stock item is recorded to the specified price variance account.
)))
*Posting class: If the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can create posting classes to provide default sales or expense accounts and subaccounts for non-stock items. If no posting class is specified for a non-stock item, the default expense subaccount is generated according to the rule specified in the '''Combine Expense Sub. From''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) form and the default sales subaccount is specified in the '''Combine Sales Sub. From''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form.
*Price information: For non-stock items of all types, you can specify price classes and assign prices that become effective on specific dates.
((({S:Hint}Only the standard cost valuation method applies to non-stock items.
)))
==Non-Stock Item Costs==
Non-stock items do not affect the company&rsquo;s inventory balance. However, to make it possible to enter the non-stock item cost and use it in the non-stock item price calculation, you can maintain standard costs for non-stock items.{br}

The standard costs are determined outside of the system, and the values should include some of the indirect and direct costs allocated. You can specify the standard cost for a non-stock item as a pending cost on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. Along with the pending cost, you can specify a date when the cost will become effective. Standard costs are defined with respect to the base unit of the stock item. {br}

If you want to update standard costs for non-stock items, use the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form. You enter a pending cost and the date for the new cost and then click '''Actions &gt; Update Cost''' on the form toolbar. The system displays only the last cost and the current cost. The historical costs that were effective before the last cost are not stored in the database.{br}

If you want to make similar changes to many or all non-stock (and possibly stock) items, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_20_00|Update Standard Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) form. On this form, you can enter new costs and compare current and pending costs side by side for all items that you select. If you are satisfied with the changes, you can update the current standard costs with the pending standard costs for all items or only selected ones. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods].
==Prices for Non-Stock Items==
You can enter default prices for non-stock items individually by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form and update the prices any time. Default prices have no expiration dates and cannot be specified as based on the items' quantities. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Base_Prices|Default Prices].

==Visibility of Inventory Items to Users==
The list of inventory items from which employees should select an item can be very long, which increases the probability of an entry error. By using restriction groups, you can reduce the list of inventory items that users see on forms. For more information about restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

For example, suppose that your organization sells furniture, and that each sales manager works with furniture for a particular room, such as kitchen, living room, and bedroom. When managers create a sales order, they should select items from only the list of furniture they sell to avoid entry mistakes. Further suppose that User K sells kitchen furniture, User L sells living room furniture, and User M sells bedroom furniture. To restrict the visibility of inventory items to the appropriate users in the system, you would create the following restriction groups with direct restriction on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_30_00|Inventory Item Access] ([~/?ScreenId=IN103000|IN103000]) form:[anchor|#_a9365235-5aa9-40ee-bb79-3221390f1298]
#Group K: In this group, include User K and all inventory IDs for kitchen furniture items.
#Group L: To this group, add User L and all inventory IDs for items of living room furniture.
#Group M: In this group, include User M and all inventory IDs for bedroom furniture items.

As a result, the visibility of the inventory items in sales orders will be restricted in the system as follows:[anchor|#_23b94234-7018-4398-a0f4-f3c82021b1ae]
*User K can view and select only inventory items for kitchen furniture.
*User L can work with only inventory items for living room furniture.
*User M can see and select only inventory items for bedroom furniture.
*Other users cannot see the inventory items that have been added to the three restriction groups in the system.

==Forms for Inventory Item Security==
In the following table, you can find the list of the forms that you can use to manage restriction groups with inventory items and the tasks that you can perform by using each form.[anchor|#_745cfbb0-e124-4e4a-86b4-3c207b3943e4]

To restrict the visibility of inventory items to the                     appropriate users in the system, you would create the following restriction                     groups with direct restriction on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN103000|IN103000]) Inventory Item Access (IN103000) form: Group K: In this group, include User K and all inventory IDs for kitchen furniture items.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Create a Non-Stock Item for Inventory You use the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form to create non-stock items                 you want to track in the system. This topic describes how to create a non-stock item for inventory with basic                 settings—that is, when the  Inventory  feature is enabled under the  Standard                     Inventory  group of features and the  Advanced Inventory  feature is                 disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. To open any form, you can navigate to it or search             for it (by its name or by its form ID without periods). For more information about             search capabilities, see  Search in the Modern UI. Before You Proceed Optional: If you use item classes for non-stock items, make sure that you have                     created an item class that provides default settings for the item you are                     creating. If you do not use item classes, make sure that the posting class, the tax                     category, and the units of measure that you want to use for the item have been                     created in the system. To Create a Non-Stock Item for Inventory Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form by searching                 for or navigating to it.  In the  Inventory ID  box, type the unique identifier of the                 item. In the  Description  box, type a description of the item that                 will help users identify it. Optional: In the  Item Class  box of the  Item                     Defaults  section on the  General Settings  tab,                 select the item class to be used to provide default settings.  Make sure that the                     default settings copied from the item class are applicable to the non-stock                     item. If not, specify new values for settings, as needed. If you have not specified an item class, on the  General                     Settings  tab, do the following : In the  Posting Class  box of the  Item                             Defaults  section, specify the posting class to provide                         posting settings for the item. In the  Tax Category  box, specify the tax category to                         be applied to the item. In the  Base Unit  box of the  Unit of                             Measure  section, specify the base unit of measure for the                         item. Optional: On the  Price/Cost Information  tab, specify the                 settings to calculate cost and price for the non-stock item.

A kit is a bundle of stock and non-stock items that increases the value of the kit components. In Acumatica ERP, you can use kits of inventory items if your organization sells multiple inventory items together and wants to track these items as a whole. For example, suppose that an organization sells cheese and wine and also offers nicely packed baskets with a bottle of wine and a set of cheese that pairs well with this wine. To track these baskets in the Inventory module, the organization uses kits, which include a bottle of wine, several cheeses, and a basket as stock items, and the delivery service and packaging as non-stock items.((({S:Hint}To use the kit functionality, make sure the ''Kit Assembly'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
In this topic, you will read about kit types and revisions of kit specifications.{br}{TOC}
==Kit Types==
You can create stock and non-stock kits. The main difference between these kit types is that the system tracks stock kits in inventory and does not track non-stock kits. The table below compares stock and non-stock kits.[anchor|#table_yfs_ffm_qy]

For detailed information on kits, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Stock_Kits|Stock Kits] and [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Non_Stock_Kits|Non-Stock Kits].
==Kit Revisions==
To represent kits in the system, you create specifications, which define the stock and non-stock items included in a kit, by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_95_00|Kit Specifications] ([~/?ScreenId=IN209500|IN209500]) form. Each specification has at least one ''revision'', which is automatically created when you create a specification. A revision is a version of the same kit, which has minor differences from the previous version. For example, suppose that your organization sells computers and offers a keyboard, a mouse, a leather case, and software installation service as a kit. If you change the vendor of leather cases, you can just change the inventory item for the case in the kit and instead of creating a new kit.{br}

For stock kits, you can create multiple revisions of the same specification. When you assemble a stock kit, you can use only the latest revision. If you need to disassemble a stock kit, you select the revision that was used for kit assembly.{br}

For non-stock kits, only one revision is created when you create a specification by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_95_00|Kit Specifications] form. You cannot add multiple revisions, as for stock kits.{br}

For each stock or non-stock kit revision, you can allow users to add components to the kit during assembly by selecting the '''Allow Component Addition''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_95_00|Kit Specifications] form and to change the quantity of components in the kit by selecting the '''Allow Component Qty. Variance''' check box for each kit component.

A stock kit is a bundle of stock and non-stock components. You create each kit and add it to inventory by processing a production transaction. The kit production subtracts the stock components from inventory and adds the kit units to inventory instead. After you have assembled a kit, you can disassemble it back to its components. When a stock kit is sold, one line item appears in the transaction, and the on-hand quantity of the kit is reduced.{br}

In this topic, you will find details about the configuration, assembly, disassembly, and cost calculation of stock kits.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Stock Kits==
You do the following to configure a stock kit:[anchor|#_63d4a36d-6746-432c-b903-67587431857f]
#You create item classes for kits with similar settings by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Item_Class|To Create an Item Class].
#You create as many kits as you need by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. To indicate that each item is a kit, you select the '''Is a Kit''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of this form. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Stock_Kit|To Create a Stock Kit].
#You create a specification for each kit by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_95_00|Kit Specifications] ([~/?ScreenId=IN209500|IN209500]) form. In the specification, you select the inventory items that will be included in the kit and specify the settings of each component. Any lot- and serial-tracked stock items can be added to the specification of a stock kit. For details on this step, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Specification_for_Stock_Kit|To Create a Specification for a Stock Kit].
#You create and release a kit assembly document by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_70_00|Kit Assembly] ([~/?ScreenId=IN307000|IN307000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Assemble_Stock_Kit|To Assemble a Stock Kit].
#You assign sales prices to kits as follows:
#*If you sell a limited number of kits, you assign the default prices on a per-kit basis by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form.
#*If you are selling more than ten kits, you assign multiple sales prices to kits by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form.

A stock kit may require a serial or lot number and an expiration date to be assigned when the kit is produced or sold, depending on the item class settings. For details on lot and serial numbers, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Lot_and_Serial_Numbers|Lot and Serial Numbers].{br}

You can disassemble a stock kit at any time. You may want to do this, for example, when its expiration date has approached.
==Assembly and Disassembly of Stock Kits==
You must assemble a stock kit by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_70_00|Kit Assembly] ([~/?ScreenId=IN307000|IN307000]) form before you add the kit to a sales order. The kit assembly document lists the components with their quantities and costs, as determined by the kit specification. Each time a stock kit is assembled and its kit assembly document is released, the on-hand quantities of the items used as components are automatically decreased, and the on-hand quantity of the kits is increased. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Assemble_Stock_Kit|To Assemble a Stock Kit].{br}

On assembly of stock kits, the standard costs of the kit&rsquo;s non-stock components are recorded to the Expense Accrual accounts specified by the '''Use Inventory/Accrual Account From''' setting of the posting class (on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form) of each of the non-stock components.{br}

If disassembly might be required for a stock kit (for example, because of an expiration date), it can be performed in accordance with the revision used to assemble the kit. You can create and release a disassembly document with the ''Disassembly'' operation selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_70_00|Kit Assembly] form. The quantity of components extracted from the kit is estimated using the disassembly coefficient specified for each stock component. However, the quantities of stock components and non-stock components are not validated in any way, and you can manually adjust the calculated quantities.{br}

For details about how to disassemble a stock kit, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Disassemble_Stock_Kit|To Disassemble a Stock Kit].
==Cost Calculation For Stock Kits==
The assembly of stock kits (with valuation methods other than the standard cost method) creates a new cost layer. The cost of a stock kit is calculated based on the costs of components when the document is released. The total cost of the kit is the total cost of stock components according to the specification&rsquo;s revision, the cost of components added during assembly, and the rates of non-stock components of the ''Labor'' and ''Service'' types multiplied by their quantities.{br}

If the standard cost method is used for the stock kit, any difference between the currently effective standard cost and the total cost of components is recorded (as with non-stock kits) to the Standard Cost Variance account determined by the posting class of the stock kit.{br}

When a stock kit is disassembled, the costs of its stock components, which are returned to inventory, are calculated depending on the valuation method of the components as follows:[anchor|#ul_txg_lkh_yx]
*''Average'': The cost of the component is calculated based on the setting of the '''Avg. Default Returns Cost''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form. By default, this setting is the average cost of the item at the warehouse. You can also select the last cost as the value of this box.
*''FIFO'': The cost of the component is calculated based on the setting of the '''FIFO Default Returns Cost''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form. By default, this setting is the average cost of the item at the warehouse. You can also select the last cost as the value of this box.
*''Specific'': The cost of the component is the average cost of the item at the warehouse. If there is no average cost of the item at the warehouse, the last cost of the item at the warehouse is used.
*''Standard'': The cost of the component is the standard cost of the item at the warehouse, if any standard cost is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. Otherwise, the global standard cost of the item defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form is used.

The kit production subtracts the stock     components from inventory and adds the kit units to inventory instead. After you have assembled     a kit, you can disassemble it back to its components. When a stock kit is sold, one line item     appears in the transaction, and the on-hand quantity of the kit is reduced. In this topic, you will find details about the configuration, assembly, disassembly, and cost     calculation of stock kits. Configuration of Stock Kits You do the following to configure a stock kit: You create item classes for kits with similar settings by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. For details, see  To Create an Item Class. You create as many kits as you need by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. To indicate that each item is a kit, you select the  Is a       Kit  check box on the  General Settings  tab of this form. For      details, see  To Create a Stock Kit. You create a specification for each kit by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN209500|IN209500]) Kit Specifications (IN209500) form. In the specification, you select the inventory items that      will be included in the kit and specify the settings of each component. Any lot- and      serial-tracked stock items can be added to the specification of a stock kit. For details on      this step, see  To Create a Specification for a Stock Kit. You create and release a kit assembly document by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN307000|IN307000]) Kit Assembly      (IN307000) form. For details, see  To Assemble a Stock Kit. You assign sales prices to kits as follows: If you sell a limited number of kits, you assign the default prices on a per-kit basis by        using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. If you are selling more than ten kits, you assign multiple sales prices to kits by using        the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) Sales Price Worksheets (AR202010) form. A stock kit may require a serial or lot number and an expiration date to be assigned when the     kit is produced or sold, depending on the item class settings. For details on lot and serial     numbers, see  Lot and Serial Numbers. You can disassemble a stock kit at any time. You may want to do this, for example, when its     expiration date has approached. Assembly and Disassembly of Stock Kits You must assemble a stock kit by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN307000|IN307000]) Kit Assembly (IN307000) form     before you add the kit to a sales order. The kit assembly document lists the components with     their quantities and costs, as determined by the kit specification. Each time a stock kit is     assembled and its kit assembly document is released, the on-hand quantities of the items used as     components are automatically decreased, and the on-hand quantity of the kits is increased. For     details, see  To Assemble a Stock Kit. On assembly of stock kits, the standard costs of the kit's non-stock components are recorded     to the Expense Accrual accounts specified by the  Use Inventory/Accrual Account      From  setting of the posting class (on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) Posting Classes     (IN206000) form) of each of the non-stock components. If disassembly might be required for a stock kit (for example, because of an expiration date),     it can be performed in accordance with the revision used to assemble the kit. You can create and     release a disassembly document with the  Disassembly  operation selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN307000|IN307000]) Kit Assembly form. The quantity of components extracted from the kit is estimated     using the disassembly coefficient specified for each stock component. However, the quantities of     stock components and non-stock components are not validated in any way, and you can manually     adjust the calculated quantities. For details about how to disassemble a stock kit, see  To Disassemble a Stock Kit. Cost Calculation For Stock Kits The assembly of stock kits (with valuation methods other than the standard cost method)     creates a new cost layer. The cost of a stock kit is calculated based on the costs of components     when the document is released. The total cost of the kit is the total cost of stock components     according to the specification's revision, the cost of components added during assembly, and the     rates of non-stock components of the  Labor  and  Service  types multiplied by their     quantities. If the standard cost method is used for the stock kit, any difference between the currently     effective standard cost and the total cost of components is recorded (as with non-stock kits) to     the Standard Cost Variance account determined by the posting class of the stock kit. When a stock kit is disassembled, the costs of its stock components, which are returned to     inventory, are calculated depending on the valuation method of the components as follows: Average : The cost of the component is calculated based on the setting of the        Avg. Default Returns Cost  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses      (IN204000) form. By default, this setting is the average cost of the item at the warehouse. You      can also select the last cost as the value of this box. FIFO : The cost of the component is calculated based on the setting of the        FIFO Default Returns Cost  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses      form. By default, this setting is the average cost of the item at the warehouse. You can also      select the last cost as the value of this box. Specific : The cost of the component is the average cost of the item at the warehouse.      If there is no average cost of the item at the warehouse, the last cost of the item at the      warehouse is used. Standard : The cost of the component is the standard cost of the item at the      warehouse, if any standard cost is defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500)      form. Otherwise, the global standard cost of the item defined on the    ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form is used.

A non-stock kit is a bundle of stock and non-stock components; you assign an individual inventory identifier to the non-stock kit, and it can be selected in sales orders. Non-stock kits are virtual kits because they neither produced nor tracked in inventory, unlike stock kits. The stock components of the non-stock kit remain in inventory and can be sold in the kit or as separate units.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the configuration, processing, and cost calculation of non-stock kits.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#nonstockkits]
==Configuration of Non-Stock Kits==
When you create a non-stock kit, you do the following:[anchor|#_a8651c20-e547-4259-8087-5559ccb78e43]
#If you need to create a number of kits with similar settings, you create an item class for each group of kits by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Item_Class|To Create an Item Class].
#You create as many kits as you need by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. To indicate that an item is a kit, you select the '''Is a Kit''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of this form. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Non_Stock_Kit|To Create a Non-Stock Kit].
#You create a specification for each kit by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_95_00|Kit Specifications] ([~/?ScreenId=IN209500|IN209500]) form. In the specification, you select the inventory items that will be included in the kit and specify the settings of each component. Any lot- and serial-tracked stock items can be added to the specification of a non-stock kit, except for items with the ''When Used'' assignment method or with the ''User-Enterable'' issue method specified for their lot/serial classes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form. For details on this step, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Specification_for_Non_Stock_Kit|To Create a Specification for a Non-Stock Kit].
#You assign sales prices to kits as follows:
#*If you sell a limited number of kits, you assign the default prices on a per-kit basis by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form.
#*If you are selling more than ten kits, you assign multiple sales prices to kits by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form.

==Processing of Non-Stock Kits ==
As with non-stock items, non-stock kits are not stocked. When non-stock kits are added to a sales order, the items are gathered for the sale but no preliminary assembly has been performed. When a non-stock kit is listed on a sales order as a line item, its stock components are specified on a pick list and shipped to the customer. Upon shipment confirmation, the quantity of stock components is decreased while the quantities of non-stock components and kits are not tracked in any way.{br}

On release of a Sales Order invoice for a non-stock kit with stock components, the system generates an inventory issue; on release of the inventory issue, the system debits the COGS accounts of the stock components, thus updating the stock components&rsquo; costs. On the sale of a non-stock kit with only non-stock components, no inventory issue is generated.{br}

When you process a sale of a non-stock kit, its stock components are issued from inventory, and the sales revenue from all components of the kit is recorded to accounts.
==Calculation of Cost for Non-Stock Kits==
The cost of a non-stock kit may include the cost of the kit itself and the costs of all stock components included in the kit. You can select one of the following cost calculation rules on in the '''Cost Calculation Basis for Non-Stock Kits''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form:[anchor|#_0a245417-0290-4289-b75e-38c12b9f6352]
*''Stock Component Cost'': The system will use the sum of the costs of the kit&rsquo;s stock components as the cost of a non-stock kit. You can select this rule if the kit does not include non-stock components or the value of the included non-stock components is very low.
*''Non-Stock Kit Standard Cost'': The system will use the standard current cost of the non-stock kit. You can select this rule if the kit does not include stock components or the value of the included stock components is very low.
*''Non-Stock Kit Standard Cost Plus Stock Component Cost'': The system will calculate the sum of the standard current cost of a non-stock kit and the costs of the stock components of this kit.

You can enter the kit standard cost directly in the '''Pending Cost''' box on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form when you create or modify the non-stock kit.((({S:Hint}Only the ''Standard Cost'' valuation method may be assigned to non-stock kits. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods].

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, item classes are used to group stock or non-stock items with similar properties and to provide default settings for new items. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you can create item classes for stock items as well as for non-stock items of each type that is used in your business. The item class is a required parameter of a stock item; the item class includes the settings that are used for availability calculation, replenishment, price management, and posting to the general ledger. A user specifies an item class when they define a new stock or non-stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form respectively, and the system fills in many values, thus saving users time and increasing the accuracy of the entered data.{br}

You can also use item classes for categorizing items. To do this, you can set the hierarchy of the item classes directly in the item class IDs. The sections below describe the specifics of configuring item classes and using them for categorizing inventory items.{br}{TOC}
==Planning the Item Class Hierarchy==
The structure of item class IDs is defined by the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key, which you can review and modify on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. This segmented key has a hierarchical structure—that is, each segment of the segmented key defines the hierarchical level. You can review the item class hierarchy in the '''Item Class Tree''' pane on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. In this pane, each item class is represented as a tree node if it has child item classes, or as a leaf of a tree if it has no child item classes.{br}

After you have defined the structure of the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key, the system shows the mask that corresponds to this structure in any box that requires the user to enter an item class ID. The characters in the mask that aren&rsquo;t yet specified are denoted with ''&#42;''; the segments are divided with the separator character specified in the '''Delimiter''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] form for ''INITEMCLASS'' (''-'' by default). For example, if you have specified three segments of two symbols each, the mask shown in a box where an item class ID must be entered will be &#42;&#42;-&#42;&#42;-&#42;&#42;.{br}

If the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key has one segment, the item classes will have a plain structure with no nested levels (see Example 1 on the diagram below). If you are going to use a plain structure of the item classes, you have to specify a sufficient length of the only segment so you can specify as many classes as you need.{br}

If you specify two or more segments in the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key, each segment after the first segment defines a subsequent level of hierarchy. Item classes that have the second segment specified are displayed at the second level of hierarchy. An item class segment of the second level directly refers to the parent item class segment of the first level. That is, under different parent item classes, you can create child item classes with the same ID of the second segment but different settings; see ''20-10 (Technical Literature)'' and ''30-10 (Paper)'' in Example 2 on the diagram below.{br}

By adding more segments to the segmented key, you can expand your ability to categorize items by item classes. For instance, you could add a third level (see the hierarchy in Example 3 on the diagram below) to make your inventory categorization even more comprehensive and flexible. By using the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key, you can specify as many levels as you need. You can append a new segment to the key at any time; however, we recommend that you carefully plan the structure of the segmented key before you start to create and use item classes.[anchor|#fig_xxq_my5_h1b][anchor|#image_yxq_my5_h1b][image:UserGuide/Images/IN_CON_ItemClassDiagram.png|popup|Item class hierarchy|450px]
==Specifying Default Item Classes==
When you create an item class (stock or non-stock) that is the child of any other item class, the system suggests the default settings of the parent class. For the classes at the first level of the item class hierarchy, which have no parent classes that could provide default settings, you can specify the default item classes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_y2z_bx1_31b]
*In the '''Default Stock Item Class''' box, you can select the stock item class whose settings will be used by default for newly created stock item classes.
*In the '''Default Non-Stock Item Class''' box, you can select the non-stock item class whose settings will be used by default for newly created non-stock item classes.

==Sequentially Selecting Child Segment Values==
When you create a new item class or enter an item class ID in any appropriate box in the system, you have to specify the needed symbols according to the mask of the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key. If you skip any of the characters in any segment, the system shows &#42; instead of a blank symbol. When you enter an item class ID, you can either enter each segment value manually, or press F3 and select the segment value from the list. For the first segment, only the segment values of the first level of hierarchy are displayed in the selection box. For each subsequent segment, in the selection list, the system shows the child segment values that are appropriate based on the previous segment or segments selected.((({S:Hint}The way the system narrows the list of segment values based on previously selected values is defined by the ''By Segments: Child Segment Values'' option selected in the '''Lookup Mode''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form; this option is the default for the ''INITEMCLASS'' segmented key. For the description of other lookup options, see the [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers] topic.
)))
==Mass-Updating Settings of Item Classes==
Suppose that you have changed some settings of a parent item class. When you changed these settings, they will apply to all newly created item classes of this parent item class, but these changes do not influence the settings of the existing child item classes of this parent item class. So if you need to have these changed settings reflected in all child item classes, you need to update them as well.{br}

To simplify the process of updating multiple child item classes, you can automatically apply the settings of the parent item class to all its child item classes. To do this, while viewing the parent class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you click '''Actions &gt; Apply to Children''' on the form toolbar. After you confirm the action, the system updates all the settings of the children of this item class on all levels of the hierarchy, so that all item classes of this tree node have identical settings.
==Deleting Item Classes with Children==
You can delete only those item classes to which no inventory items have been assigned yet. To delete an item class, you open the class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form and click '''Delete''' on the form toolbar. When you delete a parent item class, the system asks whether you want to keep the child item classes of this parent. The system proceeds as follows based on your response:[anchor|#ul_kjk_34b_31b]
*If you click '''Yes''' in the message box, the system deletes the parent item class and keeps all its the children in the hierarchy. The children item classes becomes the children of the item class at the level immediately above the deleted item class.
*If you click '''No''' in the message box, the system deletes the entire tree node of the item class hierarchy (that is, the parent item class along with all of its child item classes).

==Moving Item Classes Within the Hierarchy==
A change of one segment or multiple segments in an item class ID may influence the position of the item class in the tree. To change an item class ID, click '''Actions &gt; Change ID''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, and specify the new ID in the dialog box that opens. When you confirm the action, the item class ID changes, and the system rebuilds the item class hierarchy.
==Reviewing the Items of the Item Class==
You can review the inventory items that belong to a particular item class on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_80_00|Inventory By Item Class] ([~/?ScreenId=IN408000|IN408000]) form. The left pane of this form shows the tree of item classes. When you click an item class in the tree, the right pane of the form shows the inventory items that belong to this class.{br}

The '''Show Items''' option button specified on the right pane determines which inventory items are listed: By default, the '''Related to Only the Current Item Class'''option button is selected, which means that the table displays only the items that belong to the selected item class. To make the system show the inventory items that belong to the selected item class, along with inventory items that belong to all child item classes of the selected item class, select the '''Related to the Current and Child Item Classes''' option button.{br}

Also, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_80_00|Inventory By Item Class] form, you can quickly review to which item class a particular item belongs and which other inventory items belong to this class. To do this, select the particular inventory item by its ID in the '''Inventory ID''' box. Once you do, the system selects the item class to which the item belongs in the tree of item classes and shows all inventory items of this class in the table.
==Moving Inventory Items to Another Item Class==
For a single stock or non-stock inventory item, you can change the item class in the item&rsquo;s settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, respectively. 
If you need to move multiple inventory items to another item class at a time, you can use the cut and paste functionality on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_80_00|Inventory By Item Class] ([~/?ScreenId=IN408000|IN408000]) form. To do this, on this form, click the item class to which the needed items currently belong in the '''Item Class Tree''', select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows with the needed inventory items in the table on the right pane, and click the '''Cut Selected Records''' button on the table toolbar of the right pane. The system copies the selected rows to the clipboard. Then, in the '''Item Class Tree''', click the destination item class (the class into which you want to move the selected items), and on the table toolbar of the right pane, click the '''Paste Records''' button. The system asks whether you want to keep the settings of the moved items:[anchor|#ul_olf_ylc_31b]
*If you click '''Yes''' in the message box, the system updates the settings of the moved items to the settings of the destination item class.
*If you click '''No''' in the message box, the system keeps the settings of the moved items unchanged.

The item class is a required parameter      of     a stock item ;      the      item class includes the settings that are used for availability calculation,     replenishment, price management, and posting to the general ledger. A user specifies an item     class when they define a new stock or non-stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items     (IN202500) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form respectively, and the system     fills in many values, thus saving users time and increasing the accuracy of the entered     data. You can also use item classes      for     categorizing items . To do this, you can set the hierarchy of the item classes     directly in the item class IDs. The sections below describe the specifics of configuring item     classes and using them for categorizing inventory items. Planning the Item Class Hierarchy The structure of item class IDs is defined by the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key, which you     can review and modify on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form. This segmented     key has a hierarchical structure—that is, each segment of the segmented key      def ines      the hierarchical level. You can review the item class hierarchy in the  Item Class      Tree  pane on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. In this pane,     each item class is represented as a tree node if it has child item classes, or as a leaf of a     tree if it has no child item classes. After you have defined the structure of the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key, the system shows     the mask that corresponds to this structure in any box that requires the user to enter an item     class ID. The characters in the mask that aren't yet specified are denoted with  * ; the     segments are divided with the separator character specified in the       Delimiter  column on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys form for       INITEMCLASS  ( -  by default). For example, if you have specified three segments of     two symbols each, the mask shown in a box where an item class ID must be entered will be     **-**-**. If the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key has one segment, the item classes will have a      plain      structure with no nested levels (see Example 1 on the diagram below). If you are going to use a     plain structure of the item classes, you have to specify a sufficient length of the only segment     so you can specify as many classes as you need. If you specify two or more segments in the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key, each segment     after the first segment defines a subsequent level of hierarchy. Item classes that have the     second segment specified are displayed at the second level of hierarchy. An item class segment     of the second level     d irectly     refers  to the parent item class segment of the first level. That is, under     different parent item classes, you can create child item classes with the      same     ID of the second segment  but different settings; see  20-10 (Technical      Literature)  and  30-10 (Paper)  in Example 2 on the diagram below. By adding more segments to the segmented key, you can expand your ability to categorize items     by item classes. For instance, you could add a third level (see the hierarchy in Example 3 on     the diagram below) to make your inventory categorization even more comprehensive and flexible.     By using the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key, you can specify as many levels as you need. You     can append a new segment to the key at any time; however, we recommend that you carefully plan     the structure of the segmented key before you start to create and use item classes. Item class hierarchy Specifying Default Item Classes When you create an item class (stock or non-stock) that is the child of any other item class,     the system suggests the default settings of the parent class. For the classes at the first level     of the item class hierarchy, which have no parent classes that could provide default settings,     you can specify the default item classes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000)     form as follows: In the  Default Stock Item Class  box, you can select the stock item      class whose settings will be used by default for newly created stock item classes. In the  Default Non-Stock Item Class  box, you can select the non-stock      item class whose settings will be used by default for newly created non-stock item      classes. Sequentially Selecting Child Segment Values When you create a new item class or enter an item class ID in any appropriate box in the     system, you have to specify the needed symbols according to the mask of the  INITEMCLASS      segmented key. If you skip any of the characters in any segment, the system shows * instead of a     blank symbol. When you enter an item class ID, you can either enter each segment value manually,     or press F3 and select the segment value from the list. For the first segment, only the segment     values of the first level of hierarchy are displayed in the selection box. For each subsequent     segment, in the selection list, the system shows the child segment values that are appropriate     based on the previous segment or segments selected. The way the system narrows the list of segment values based on previously selected values     is defined by the  By Segments: Child Segment Values  option selected in the       Lookup Mode  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000)     form; this option is the default for the  INITEMCLASS  segmented key. For the description     of other lookup options, see the  Segmented Identifiers     topic. Mass-Updating Settings of Item Classes Suppose that you have changed some settings of a parent item class. When you changed these     settings, they will apply to all newly created item classes of this parent item class, but these     changes do not influence the settings of the existing child item classes of this parent item     class. So if you need to have these changed settings reflected in all child item classes, you     need to update them as well. To simplify the process of updating multiple child item classes, you can automatically apply     the settings of the parent item class to all its child item classes. To do this, while viewing     the parent class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, you click  Actions > Apply to Children  on the form toolbar. After you confirm the action, the system updates all the     settings of the children of this item class on all levels of the hierarchy, so that      all     item classes of this tree node have identical settings . Deleting Item Classes with Children You can delete only those item classes to which no inventory items have been assigned yet. To     delete an item class, you open the class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000)     form and click  Delete  on the form toolbar. When you delete a parent item     class, the system asks whether you want to keep the child item classes of this parent. The     system proceeds as follows based on your response: If you click  Yes  in the message box, the system deletes the parent      item class and keeps all its the children in the hierarchy. The children item classes becomes      the children of the item class at the level immediately above the deleted item class. If you click  No  in the message box, the system deletes the entire      tree node of the item class hierarchy (that is, the parent item class along with all of its      child item classes). Moving Item Classes Within the Hierarchy A change of one segment or multiple segments in an item class ID may influence the position of     the item class in the tree. To change an item class ID, click  Actions > Change ID  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form,     and specify the new ID in the dialog box that opens. When you confirm the action, the item class     ID changes, and the system rebuilds the item class hierarchy. Reviewing the Items of the Item Class You can review the inventory items that belong to a particular item class on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN408000|IN408000]) Inventory By Item Class (IN408000) form. The left pane of this form shows the tree of item     classes. When you click an item class in the tree, the right pane of the form shows the     inventory items that belong to this class. The  Show Items  option button specified on the right pane determines     which inventory items are listed: By default, the  Related to Only the Current Item      Class option button is selected, which means that the table displays only the items     that belong to the selected item class. To make the system show the inventory items that belong     to the selected item class, along with inventory items that belong to all child item classes of     the selected item class, select the  Related to the Current and Child Item      Classes  option button. Also, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN408000|IN408000]) Inventory By Item Class form, you can quickly review to which item class     a particular item belongs and which other inventory items belong to this class. To do this,     select the particular inventory item by its ID in the  Inventory ID  box.     Once you do, the system selects the item class to which the item belongs in the tree of item     classes and shows all inventory items of this class in the table. Moving Inventory Items to Another Item Class For a single stock or non-stock inventory item, you can change the item class in the item's     settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, respectively.  If you need to move multiple inventory items to another item class at a time, you can use the     cut and paste functionality on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN408000|IN408000]) Inventory By Item Class (IN408000) form. To do     this, on this form, click the item class to which the needed items currently belong in the       Item Class Tree , select the unlabeled check boxes in the rows with the     needed inventory items in the table on the right pane, and click the  Cut Selected      Records  button on the table toolbar of the right pane. The system copies the     selected rows to the clipboard. Then, in the  Item Class Tree , click the     destination item class (the class into which you want to move the selected items), and on the     table toolbar of the right pane, click the  Paste Records  button. The     system asks whether you want to keep the settings of the moved items: If you click  Yes  in the message box, the system updates the settings      of the moved items to the settings of the destination item class. If you click  No  in the message box, the system keeps the settings of      the moved items unchanged. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
For convenience during the processing of purchase and sales orders, in Acumatica ERP, you can define the relationships between the inventory item identifiers maintained by your company and those used by your vendors and customers. These cross-references associate the internal inventory ID of an inventory item with an alternate ID for the item that is used by the vendor or customer. For information on inventory IDs, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_IDs_and_Subitem_Codes|Inventory Subitems].{br}

Once these cross-references are established in the system, when you enter a customer&rsquo;s sales order and specify the alternate ID for an inventory item, the system inserts the associated inventory ID and item price in the order line. Cross-referencing saves time that would be spent on handling customer and vendor orders and helps you avoid costly errors. You can also enable the ability to load prices specified by alternate IDs to sales price worksheets and vendor price worksheets. {br}

The types of cross-references that are supported in Acumatica ERP are described in the sections below.{br}{TOC}
==Using Alternate IDs==
You can manage cross-references for inventory items in the Inventory module. You create cross-references by using the '''Cross-References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form for a stock item and of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form for a non-stock item. When you add a cross-reference to the table on the '''Cross-References''' tab, you select one of the following types in the '''Alternate Type''' column:[anchor|#ul_fmq_swd_zz]
*''Global'': This is a global cross-reference for the item. For this type, you do not need to specify a particular customer or vendor. You can use global alternate IDs in sales orders, invoices, purchase orders, purchase receipts, purchase requests and purchase requisitions, sales price worksheets, and vendor price worksheets.
*''Customer Part Number'': The alternate ID is specific to a particular customer (specified in the '''Customer/Vendor '''column); this ID can be used in sales orders.
*''Vendor Part Number'': The alternate ID is specific to a particular vendor (specified in the '''Customer/Vendor '''column); this ID can be used in purchase orders and purchase requisitions.
*''Barcode'': The barcode associated with the item. You can use barcodes in sales orders, invoices, purchase orders, purchase receipts, purchase requests and purchase requisitions, sales price worksheets, and vendor price worksheets.

If subitems are used in your system to split an inventory ID by item properties (such as color, fabric, or size), alternate IDs are specified for the inventory ID–subitem pair. The way alternate IDs are specified depends on whether the partner (the customer or vendor) uses the same classification of items or its classification has more or fewer details than are maintained in Acumatica ERP. If the partner IDs include classification by properties specified by subitem, you match its IDs to your inventory ID–subitem pairs. If the partner&rsquo;s alternate IDs don&rsquo;t include classification provided by subitems, you use the partner IDs concatenated with subitems as alternate IDs. In any case, to ensure unique identification by alternate IDs, you should establish internal rules on specifying alternate IDs. {br}

If subitems are not used in your system along with inventory IDs to identify inventory, then for each inventory item, you can provide multiple alternate IDs used by customers and by vendors. You can also specify alternate IDs specific to particular units of measure, as described in the sections below.{br}

The system does not verify the uniqueness of alternate IDs in the system. However, an alternate ID is unique for each vendor or customer, and you can find the items you want to add to an order by typing their alternate IDs in the '''Inventory ID''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. 
==Configuring the ''INVENTORY'' Segmented Key==
If you plan to use customer and vendor alternate IDs for stock and non-stock items, keep in mind that alternate IDs may have more characters than you have planned for your inventory IDs and that they may have different lengths in the systems of different vendors and customers. To avoid inserting unnecessary zeros or other characters in each inventory ID, take into account the following recommendations when you configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form: [anchor|#ol_mg1_1hc_sv]
#You should configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key as a single-segment key. The length of the segment must be equal to the maximum possible length of alternate IDs.
#You select the ''Unicode'' option in the '''Edit Mask''' column for this segment of the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key. Otherwise, errors may result from alternate IDs that contain numbers, letters, special characters, and spaces.
#If you plan to use automatic numbering for inventory items, you should do the following:
##Select the '''Auto-Number''' option for the segment.
## In the '''Numbering ID''' box, select the numbering sequence to be used to generate identifiers for new items. This numbering sequence may be defined on [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form with the '''Start Number''' and '''End Number''' that have fewer characters than the segment length. 
#If you plan to enter the inventory IDs for items manually, you should make sure the '''Validate''' check box is cleared for the segment—then the users will be able to enter identifiers with less characters than the specified segment length. 

==Using Customer Alternate IDs==
Customer alternate IDs are inventory identifiers (such as part numbers) used by customers for the items. Because different customers may use different identifiers to refer to the same product (defined as an item in Acumatica ERP), you can create multiple alternate IDs for the product (one for each customer per item). You can specify a customer alternate ID for an item by using the '''Cross-References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. {br}

If you have specified an alternate ID for the item, the system shows this ID in the '''Alternate ID''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. If you enter a new value in this column while editing a sales order, the system will create a new customer-specific alternate ID or replace the existing customer-specific alternate ID for the item specified in the document line.{br}

When you create a sales order, once you select the customer, you can add each item to the order by typing its alternate ID (that is, the alternate ID associated with this customer) in the '''Inventory ID''' column. Once you enter the alternate ID, the system will automatically search for the stock or non-stock item and insert its settings in the document line. When you add items to a sales order by using the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box, which you invoke by clicking the '''Add Stock Item''' button on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, you can also search for stock items in this dialog box by alternate ID.((({S:Hint}The '''Alternate ID''' column in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box becomes populated only after you have typed a string in the '''Inventory''' box and the system has performed a search for the items with inventory IDs, alternate IDs, and descriptions that match the string.
)))
==Using Vendor Alternate IDs==
Vendor alternate IDs are inventory identifiers used by your company&rsquo;s vendors for the product (defined as an item in Acumatica ERP). As with customer alternate IDs, you can maintain multiple vendor alternate IDs (one for each vendor per item) in the Inventory module. You can specify a vendor alternate ID for an item by using the '''Cross-References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. {br}

If you have specified an alternate ID for an item, the system shows this ID in the '''Alternate ID''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. If you enter a new value in this column while editing a purchase order, the system will create a new vendor-specific alternate ID or replace the existing vendor-specific alternate ID for the item specified in the document line.{br}

When you create a purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, once you select the vendor, you can add each item to the order by typing its alternate ID (that is, the alternate ID associated with this vendor) in the '''Inventory ID''' column. Once you enter the alternate ID, the system will automatically search for the stock or non-stock item and insert its settings in the document line. When you add items to a purchase order by using the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box, which you invoke by clicking the '''Add Item''' button on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, you can also search for the stock items in this dialog box by alternate ID.((({S:Hint}The '''Alternate ID''' column in the '''Inventory Lookup''' dialog box becomes populated only after you have typed a string in the '''Inventory''' box and the system has performed a search for the items with inventory IDs, alternate IDs, and descriptions that match the string.
)))
==Using Vendor Catalogs==
For inventory items your company frequently purchases from a particular vendor, you can maintain a vendor catalog on either the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) form or the '''Vendor Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Along with alternate IDs, you can specify the vendor's last prices for the items and update them with the prices quoted on vendor documents, such as receipts or even purchase orders. When they create purchase orders, users will be able to see the vendor's last prices for the items listed on the orders. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Vendor_Catalog|Vendor Catalogs]. 
==Using Barcodes==
Most products (items) that are sold or purchased have barcodes. A barcode is a machine-readable graphical representation of data that contains information about the product to which the barcode is attached. A special scanner is used to read the information encoded in the image. Scanner software converts barcodes to alphanumeric strings. Barcodes are specific to the company that manufactures or resells the products. Different barcode standards are used for different types of products and in different world regions. {br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can use barcodes as alternate IDs for inventory items. On creating a receipt by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form, a user scans a barcode of the product and associates it with the inventory ID used for this product in the system. {br}

Alternatively, barcodes can be entered manually or by using a scanner on the '''Cross-References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. Any number of barcodes can be entered for the same item. For barcodes, no association with a particular vendor or customer is required. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\PO__con_Barcode_Support|Barcode Support]. [anchor|#_119e97a3-c747-4cea-a699-ef56e2ead6b5]
==Using Cross-Reference Units of Measure==
The system provides you with the ability to define and use cross-reference units of measure other than the default sales or purchase units specified for the item. For an alternate ID of any type specified on the '''Cross-References''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, you can specify the unit of measure in the '''Unit of Measure''' column.{br}

When you add items to the sales order or purchase order by entering the alternate ID in the '''Inventory ID''' column of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] form or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form, the system searches for the item by its alternate ID, replaces the alternate ID identifier in this column with the item, and specifies the cross-reference unit of measure in the '''UOM''' column. If an alternate ID does not have a unit of measure specified, the system will use the default sales or purchase unit in the document line.((({S:Hint}In the '''Unit of Measure''' column, you can specify only those units of measure that are defined for the item in the '''Unit Conversion''' table on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.

==Uploading Prices with Alternate IDs and Creating Alternate IDs from Price Worksheets==
In the system, you can make it possible to upload prices in worksheets with alternate IDs instead of item identifiers defined in the system, and to create alternate IDs for inventory items on release of worksheets. To be able to use alternate IDs in price lists, you need to do the following:[anchor|#ul_vzs_b3k_zz]
*To enable these capabilities for sales price worksheets, you need to select the '''Load Sales Prices by Alternate ID''' check box on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] form. Once you do, the '''Alternate ID''' column appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form. 
*To enable these capabilities for vendor price worksheets, you need to select the '''Load Vendor Prices by Alternate ID''' check box on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] form. Once you do, the '''Alternate ID''' column appears on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_20_20_10|Vendor Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) form.

After you enter the '''Alternate ID''' on either of these price worksheet forms (or upload an Excel file with alternate IDs and prices specified), the system searches for the items by their alternate IDs (that is, cross-references) and automatically populates the following columns in the worksheet lines: [anchor|#ul_gzq_tjp_d1b]
*'''Inventory ID''': The ID of the stock or non-stock item, which the system located by using its alternate ID.
*'''Description''': The description that has been specified for the item.
*'''UOM''': The cross-reference unit of measure, if one has been defined for alternate ID that was entered in the worksheet line.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Item Cross-References For convenience during the processing of purchase and sales orders, in  Acumatica ERP, you can define the relationships between the inventory item identifiers 				maintained by your company and those used by your vendors and customers. These 				cross-references associate the internal inventory ID of an inventory item with an 				alternate ID for the item that is used by the vendor or customer. For information on 				inventory IDs, see  Inventory Subitems. Once these cross-references are established in the system, when you enter a 				customer's sales order and specify the alternate ID for an inventory item, the 				system inserts the associated inventory ID and item price in the order line. 				Cross-referencing saves time that would be spent on handling customer and vendor 				orders and helps you avoid costly errors. You can also enable the ability to load 				prices specified by alternate IDs to sales price worksheets and vendor price 				worksheets.  The types of cross-references that are supported in  Acumatica ERP are described in the sections below. Using Alternate IDs You can manage cross-references for inventory items in the Inventory module. You 				create cross-references by using the  Cross-References  tab of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form for a stock 				item and of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form for a non-stock 				item. When you add a cross-reference to the table on the 					 Cross-References  tab, you select one of the following 				types in the  Alternate Type  column: Global : This is a global cross-reference for the item. For this type, you 					do not need to specify a particular customer or vendor. You can use global 					alternate IDs in sales orders, invoices, purchase orders, purchase receipts, 					purchase requests and purchase requisitions, sales price worksheets, and vendor 					price worksheets. Customer Part Number : The alternate ID is specific to a particular 					customer (specified in the  Customer/Vendor  column); this 					ID can be used in sales orders. Vendor Part Number : The alternate ID is specific to a particular vendor 					(specified in the  Customer/Vendor  column); this ID can be 					used in purchase orders and purchase requisitions. Barcode : The barcode associated with the item. You can use barcodes in 					sales orders, invoices, purchase orders, purchase receipts, purchase requests 					and purchase requisitions, sales price worksheets, and vendor price 					worksheets. If subitems are used in your system to split an inventory ID by item properties (such 				as color, fabric, or size), alternate IDs are specified for the inventory 				ID–subitem pair. The way alternate IDs are specified depends on whether the 				partner (the customer or vendor) uses the same classification of items or its 				classification has more or fewer details than are maintained in  Acumatica ERP. If the partner IDs include classification by properties specified by subitem, 				you match its IDs to your inventory ID–subitem pairs. If the partner's 				alternate IDs don't include classification provided by subitems, you use the partner 				IDs concatenated with subitems as alternate IDs. In any case, to ensure unique 				identification by alternate IDs, you should establish internal rules on specifying 				alternate IDs.  If subitems are not used in your system along with inventory IDs to identify 				inventory, then for each inventory item, you can provide multiple alternate IDs used 				by customers and by vendors. You can also specify alternate IDs specific to 				particular units of measure, as described in the sections below. The system does not verify the uniqueness of alternate IDs in the system. However, an 				alternate ID is unique for each vendor or customer, and you can find the items you 				want to add to an order by typing their alternate IDs in the  Inventory 					ID  column on the  Document Details  tab of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders 				(PO301000) form.  Configuring the  INVENTORY  Segmented Key If you plan to use customer and vendor alternate IDs for stock and non-stock items, 				keep in mind that alternate IDs may have more characters than you have planned for 				your inventory IDs and that they may have different lengths in the systems of 				different vendors and customers. To avoid inserting unnecessary zeros or other 				characters in each inventory ID, take into account the following recommendations 				when you configure the  INVENTORY  segmented key on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form:  You should configure the  INVENTORY  segmented key as a single-segment key. 					The length of the segment must be equal to the maximum possible length of 					alternate IDs. You select the  Unicode  option in the  Edit Mask  					column for this segment of the  INVENTORY  segmented key. Otherwise, errors 					may result from alternate IDs that contain numbers, letters, special characters, 					and spaces. If you plan to use automatic numbering for inventory items, you should do the 						following: Select the  Auto-Number  option for the 							segment.  In the  Numbering ID  box, select the numbering 							sequence to be used to generate identifiers for new items. This 							numbering sequence may be defined on   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences 							(CS201010) form with the  Start Number  and 								 End Number  that have fewer characters than 							the segment length.  If you plan to enter the inventory IDs for items manually, you should make sure 					the  Validate  check box is cleared for the segment—then 					the users will be able to enter identifiers with less characters than the 					specified segment length.  Using Customer Alternate IDs Customer alternate IDs are inventory identifiers (such as part numbers) used by 				customers for the items. Because different customers may use different identifiers 				to refer to the same product (defined as an item in  Acumatica ERP), you can create multiple alternate IDs for the product (one for each customer 				per item). You can specify a customer alternate ID for an item by using the 					 Cross-References  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form or the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form.  If you have specified an alternate ID for the item, the system shows this ID in the 					 Alternate ID  column on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form. If you enter a new value in this column 				while editing a sales order, the system will create a new customer-specific 				alternate ID or replace the existing customer-specific alternate ID for the item 				specified in the document line. When you create a sales order, once you select the customer, you can add each item to 				the order by typing its alternate ID (that is, the alternate ID associated with this 				customer) in the  Inventory ID  column. Once you enter the 				alternate ID, the system will automatically search for the stock or non-stock item 				and insert its settings in the document line. When you add items to a sales order by 				using the  Inventory Lookup  dialog box, which you invoke by 				clicking the  Add Stock Item  button on the  Document 					Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) 				form, you can also search for stock items in this dialog box by alternate ID. The  Alternate ID  column in the  Inventory 					Lookup  dialog box becomes populated only after you have typed a 				string in the  Inventory  box and the system has performed a 				search for the items with inventory IDs, alternate IDs, and descriptions that match 				the string. Using Vendor Alternate IDs Vendor alternate IDs are inventory identifiers used by your company's vendors for the 				product (defined as an item in  Acumatica ERP). As with customer alternate IDs, you can maintain multiple vendor alternate IDs 				(one for each vendor per item) in the Inventory module. You can specify a vendor 				alternate ID for an item by using the  Cross-References  tab of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form or the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form.  If you have specified an alternate ID for an item, the system shows this ID in the 					 Alternate ID  column on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. If you enter a new value in this column 				while editing a purchase order, the system will create a new vendor-specific 				alternate ID or replace the existing vendor-specific alternate ID for the item 				specified in the document line. When you create a purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, once 				you select the vendor, you can add each item to the order by typing its alternate ID 				(that is, the alternate ID associated with this vendor) in the  Inventory 					ID  column. Once you enter the alternate ID, the system will 				automatically search for the stock or non-stock item and insert its settings in the 				document line. When you add items to a purchase order by using the 					 Inventory Lookup  dialog box, which you invoke by clicking 				the  Add Item  button on the  Document 					Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) 				form, you can also search for the stock items in this dialog box by alternate 				ID. The  Alternate ID  column in the  Inventory 					Lookup  dialog box becomes populated only after you have typed a 				string in the  Inventory  box and the system has performed a 				search for the items with inventory IDs, alternate IDs, and descriptions that match 				the string. Using Vendor Catalogs For inventory items your company frequently purchases from a particular vendor, you 				can maintain a vendor catalog on either the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) Vendor Inventory (PO201000) form or the  Vendor Info  tab 				of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. Along with alternate IDs, 				you can specify the vendor's last prices for the items and update them with the 				prices quoted on vendor documents, such as receipts or even purchase orders. When 				they create purchase orders, users will be able to see the vendor's last prices for 				the items listed on the orders. For more information, see  Vendor Catalogs.  Using Barcodes Most products (items) that are sold or purchased have barcodes. A barcode is a 				machine-readable graphical representation of data that contains information about 				the product to which the barcode is attached. A special scanner is used to read the 				information encoded in the image. Scanner software converts barcodes to alphanumeric 				strings. Barcodes are specific to the company that manufactures or resells the 				products. Different barcode standards are used for different types of products and 				in different world regions.  With  Acumatica ERP, you can use barcodes as alternate IDs for inventory items. On creating a receipt 				by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts (PO302000) form, a user scans a 				barcode of the product and associates it with the inventory ID used for this product 				in the system.  Alternatively, barcodes can be entered manually or by using a scanner on the 					 Cross-References  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. Any number of barcodes can be entered for the same item. For barcodes, no 				association with a particular vendor or customer is required. For details, see  Barcode Support.  Using Cross-Reference Units of Measure The system provides you with the ability to define and use cross-reference units of 				measure other than the default sales or purchase units specified for the item. For 				an alternate ID of any type specified on the  Cross-References  				tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, you can specify the unit of 				measure in the  Unit of Measure  column. When you add items to the sales order or purchase order by entering the alternate ID 				in the  Inventory ID  column of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders form or   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form, the 				system searches for the item by its alternate ID, replaces the alternate ID 				identifier in this column with the item, and specifies the cross-reference unit of 				measure in the  UOM  column. If an alternate ID does not have a 				unit of measure specified, the system will use the default sales or purchase unit in 				the document line. In the  Unit of Measure  column, you can specify only those 				units of measure that are defined for the item in the  Unit 					Conversion  table on the  General Settings  tab 				of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. Uploading Prices with Alternate IDs and Creating Alternate IDs from Price 				Worksheets In the system, you can make it possible to upload prices in worksheets with alternate 				IDs instead of item identifiers defined in the system, and to create alternate IDs 				for inventory items on release of worksheets. To be able to use alternate IDs in 				price lists, you need to do the following: To enable these capabilities for sales price worksheets, you need to select the 						 Load Sales Prices by Alternate ID  check box on the 						 Price/Discount Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences form. Once you do, the  Alternate 						ID  column appears on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) Sales Price Worksheets 					(AR202010) form.  To enable these capabilities for vendor price worksheets, you need to select the 						 Load Vendor Prices by Alternate ID  check box on the 						 Price/Discount Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) Accounts Payable Preferences form. Once you do, the  Alternate 						ID  column appears on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP202010|AP202010]) Vendor Price Worksheets 					(AP202010) form. After you enter the  Alternate ID  on either of these price 				worksheet forms (or upload an Excel file with alternate IDs and prices specified), 				the system searches for the items by their alternate IDs (that is, cross-references) 				and automatically populates the following columns in the worksheet lines:  Inventory ID : The ID of the stock or non-stock item, 					which the system located by using its alternate ID. Description : The description that has been specified for 					the item. UOM : The cross-reference unit of measure, if one has been 					defined for alternate ID that was entered in the worksheet line. If a 					cross-reference unit of measure has not been defined, this column is populated 					with the default sales unit (in the sales price worksheet) or purchase unit (in 					the vendor price worksheet).  If the alternate ID specified in the worksheet line is not found, when the worksheet 				is released, the system will create a global alternate ID and assign it to the 				inventory ID that is specified in the price worksheet line.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500])  ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000])  ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) ]]></column>

For each stock item, Acumatica ERP provides a basic set of properties of the item. These properties include the item&rsquo;s identifier, description, price, cost, units of measure, default warehouse, and default vendor information.{br}

Stock items can have additional properties, known as ''attributes'' in Acumatica ERP, that do not affect item processing in the Inventory module but may help your organization analyze stock movements or item sales. Attributes may differ for different types of inventory items.
==Types of Attributes==
In Acumatica ERP, product attributes are completely customizable. You can create attributes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form. You can decide what attributes are needed, what values are allowed for each, and what control (type of element) is used to implement the attribute on the interface. Attributes may be of the following types: 
*'''Free text''': Users can enter any text as the attribute value.
*'''Masked text''': The attribute text users enter must comply with a certain mask or validation rule (defined as a regular expression).
*'''Date/time''': The user selects a date-time value.
*'''Check box''': The attribute is a Boolean value, which means that the user can only select or clear it (such as ''yes/no'', ''true/false'', or ''on/off'').
*'''Combo box''': The user selects the attribute value from a predefined list that consists of values you specify when you create the attribute. For each value, you specify its ID (such as ''1M''), its description (such as ''Less than 1,000,000''), and its sort order. Values with smaller sort orders are listed nearer to the top of the combo box list.

Also, you can define an attribute as an optional or required. This allows items to have no value for the attribute. Alternatively, you can define a special value such as ''None'' or ''N/A'' (not applicable) for use with such items. 
==Attribute Assignment==
You assign attributes at the item class level by using the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. The same attribute can be used for one or several item classes. The attributes for a newly created item class are by default those of the parent item class. If the created item class has no parent, the default attributes are those of the class that is specified in the '''Default Stock Item Class''' box (if you are creating a stock item class) or the '''Default Non-Stock Item Class''' box (if you are creating a non-stock item class) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.{br}

When a user creates a new inventory item and assigns it to an item class by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, the system will display the list of attributes assigned to the item's class. All items of the same item class will have the same set of attributes, although their values may differ for different items. For example, if you define a color attribute for an item class, each item in the class will have this attribute but the items can have different colors (or this attribute can be optional). {br}

Because item classes have different lists of attributes, users can have more complete information about each item. You can design custom reports to allow users to analyze information provided by item attributes.

Lot numbers and serial numbers are used to track certain types of inventory items as they are received, stored, manufactured, and shipped. Some products, such as food products and chemical compounds, are tracked because they have expiration dates, while other products, such as medications, are tracked because laws require manufacturers to keep accurate records about their distribution. Still other products—such as electronics, appliances, and cars—must be tracked individually from the manufacturer to the consumer because of safety and warranty issues. {br}

If the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can set up tracking of stock items by lot or serial number, as well as by expiration date. ([HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Lot_and_Serial_Number_Tracking|Lot and Serial Number Tracking] gives additional information about this tracking.) Acumatica ERP provides flexible numbering schemes for lot and serial numbers and gives you the option to track different products differently. It also provides different valuation methods to account for the cost of inventory for each lot or serial number. Kits may have their own serial numbers while also containing components that have lot and serial numbers. {br}{TOC}
==Lot and Serial Numbers==
 A serial number is a unique number that identifies a single item of stock, such as a camera, DVD player, or bicycle. Serial numbers can be generated by the system, or you can assign them manually on a per-item basis so the system reflects the numbers provided by the manufacturer. {br}

A lot number is a unique identification code assigned to a specific quantity or ''lot'' of a product. A lot number includes the information about the inventory item model and may include an expiration date. The same lot number is assigned to every item of the lot. The lot size is generally specified on the purchase order or on the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. ((({S:Hint}Lot numbers can be tracked only for base units.
)))
If component parts as well as assembled kits have lot or serial numbers, your company will know precisely which assembled kits contain any component, if this information is requested by the component manufacturer. 
==Lot and Serial Classes==
The settings of lot and serial numbers are defined at the item class level by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form. Lot or serial classes are divided into three groups based on their tracking method: 
*Classes of items that are not tracked by either number; you should define at least one lot/serial class for such items
*Classes whose items are tracked by lot numbers
*Classes whose items are tracked by serial numbers

Use the following guidelines when you&rsquo;re deciding which lot/serial classes to create: 
*Define a class intended for items that will not be tracked. This class can be used as the default lot/serial class if most inventory items will not be tracked by any property.
*Create separate groups of classes for items with serial numbers and items with lot numbers. Within each group, create separate classes for items with expiration dates and without them, if both types of products are involved in your business.
*Use separate classes to group items to which serial numbers are assigned on receipt and on usage. Items purchased for further sale generally are assigned numbers on their receipt, while items produced (and kits assembled) are assigned numbers on their sale or usage.
*Consider using additional classes for items with different issue methods: FIFO, sequential, date, and custom.

 Acumatica ERP provides flexible tools that you can use to configure different templates for generating such numbers, or you can manually enter them. Other settings of the lot/serial classes define how and when the numbers will be generated, whether expiration dates are assigned and tracked, and what order is used for issuing the items from warehouses. 
==Lot/Serial Class Settings==
When creating a class whose items will be tracked by lot or serial numbers, you specify the following information on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form: 
*Which tracking method is used for the class.
*Whether to track expiration dates or not.
*What is the maximum number of lot or serial numbers that can be assigned at once, which is controlled by the '''Auto-Generate Number Batch Size''' setting. If a larger quantity of the item is specified on a document, only the maximum number of lot/serial numbers will be generated, with the excess quantity remaining with unassigned numbers. You can initiate the assignment of lot/serial numbers for an unassigned quantity of the item manually.
*How the numbers are assigned. The assignment method is one of the following: 
**''When Received'': Items get lot/serial numbers when they are received, and they&rsquo;re handled as lot- or serial-numbered items throughout their &ldquo;life&ldquo; in stock until they are issued from a warehouse.
**''When Used'': The lot/serial numbers are not assigned to items until they&rsquo;re issued from stock or used in kit assembly; before that, items are handled as non-tracked stock items. If such an item is returned by a customer, this item can be issued again with the same lot or serial number.
*What the issue method is for items of the class, which can be one of the following: 
**''FIFO'': Lot/serial numbers are picked for issue by receipt date (oldest first).
**''LIFO'': Lot/serial numbers are picked for issue by receipt date (newest first).
**''Sequential'': Lot/serial numbers are picked in sequential order.
**''Expiration'': Lot/serial numbers are picked by expiration date (faster-expiring first). We recommend that you select ''Expiration'' as the issue method for items with a rather short shelf life.
**''Custom'' (''User-Enterable''): This method is not implemented in the current version.

==Segmented Structure of Lot And Serial Numbers==
Lot and serial numbers are segmented, and you can decide how many and what kind of segments there should be. Acumatica ERP supports the following types of segments: 
*''Constant'': A segment of this type is a predefined alphanumeric string to be used in all lot or serial numbers generated for items of the class.
*''Date'': A segment of this type will be generated based on the relevant date (of receipt or of usage), which may include day, month number, month name, and two- or four-digit year value.
*''Auto-incremental value'': A value for the segment of this type is automatically computed by the system when a new lot/serial number is generated, because a numbering sequence is actually used.
((({S:Warn}To correctly configure lot or serial numbers for a class, assign a numbering sequence to one of the segments.
)))
The same numbering sequence can be used for all items of the class if you select the '''Share Auto-Incremental Value Between All Class Items''' check box. In this case, sequential numbers may be assigned to different inventory items, which in some cases may be inconvenient. If this check box is not selected, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, for each inventory item of the class, you can specify which will have the same segment auto-numbered, a separate auto-incremental values—that is, an individual initial string of digits to be auto-incremented. To prevent generation of similar serial numbers for different items of the same class, consider using different initial strings (auto-incremented values) for items of the class, so that numbers for different items will be generated in non-intersecting ranges. {br}

For example, imagine that there are 10 items in a lot/serial class. During a year, no more than 1000 units of any item pass through warehouses. The auto-incremental values for items can be selected in the following way: 000000, 100000, 200000, ... , 900000. If additional items (beyond 10) will be added to the class, new auto-incremental values can be used for them. 
==Assignment to Stock Items==
Each stock item is assigned to a lot/serial class that defines whether the items will be tracked by lot or serial numbers. Stock items are assigned to lot/serial classes using the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. {br}

After that, lot and serial numbers, if any should be assigned, are generated automatically by the system when the inventory items are received, issued, or assembled, depending on the assignment method of the lot/serial class. When such items are moved (transferred between warehouses or sold), you can invoke the '''Allocations''' dialog box to view or specify particular lot or serial numbers to be transferred or picked for the sales order, depending on the issue method selected for the class. ((({S:Hint}You cannot change an assignment method selected for the lot/serial class for another assignment method if there are any history transactions with any item of the class, or any unreleased document that includes an item of the class, or any non-zero quantity of any item of the class at any location.

Items to be tracked should be assigned to specific lot/serial classes you&rsquo;ve created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_70_00|Lot/Serial Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) form. For more details on configuring lot and serial numbers, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Lot_and_Serial_Numbers|Lot and Serial Numbers]. {br}{TOC}
==Assigning Lot Numbers on Receipts==
Generally, lot numbers are assigned to items when they are received (with the ''When Received'' assignment method). Lot numbers are used to track perishable goods, chemical and medical supplies, and other goods for which laws require companies to maintain accurate records and traceability to the end customer. {br}

The lot size for each lot-numbered stock item is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) form. When you enter a purchase receipt for lot-numbered items, you can specify the quantities of items in units of measure other than base units; in this case, the system converts the quantity on receipt to base units and calculates how many lots are received. The system then generates lot numbers according to the lot number templates specified by the lot/serial classes the items are assigned to. The same lot number is assigned to all base units in the lot. {br}

For the receipt, you can run the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_92_00|Inventory Item Labels] ([~/?ScreenId=IN619200|IN619200]) report to print labels for products. This can be useful for physical inventories and for picking items for sales orders. {br}

Consider this example of unit conversion: Suppose that you create a purchase receipt for two crates of lot-numbered goods for which the following information applies: 
*The base unit is ''PIECE''.
*A crate contains 12 pieces.
*The lot size is a crate.

For this transaction, the system will generate two lot numbers and create two receipt transactions. 
==Tracking Lot Numbers on Sales Orders==
If your company produces or resells items with expiration dates, you can assign lot numbers to items on their sale (with the ''When Used '' assignment method). When you enter a lot-numbered stock item on a sales order, the system generates the list of particular lot numbers with quantities of the item in the base unit.{br}

For items with the ''When Received'' assignment method, the item&rsquo;s specific units are picked in accordance with the issue method assigned to the item&rsquo;s lot/serial class as follows: 
*''FIFO'': The units with the earliest receipt dates will be selected for the order.
*''LIFO'': The units with the latest receipt dates will be selected for the order.
*''Expiration'': The units with the earliest expiration dates will be selected for the order.
*''Sequential'': The units from the top of the list (with lot numbers ordered sequentially) will be selected for the order.
*''Custom'': The units with lot numbers you manually select will be used for the order.

If the sales unit is smaller than the base unit for an item tracked by lot number (that is, the base unit consists of several sales units), the item may be sold in fractional quantities with the specified lot number. 
==Assigning Serial Numbers on Receipts==
With serialized inventory (inventory items with serial numbers), you can maintain the history of any serial number, track its costs and find the customer in case of recall. {br}

For stock items with serial numbers, the base unit should be the smallest unit of measure used for the item; in such cases, the same unit is used as the purchase unit, sales unit, and the base unit. ((({S:Hint}To enable tracking of serial numbers from vendor to customer, for items with the ''When Received'' method, you can configure the serial numbers so that one of the segments of serial numbers can be used for these manufacturer&rsquo;s numbers. 
)))
 When you enter a purchase receipt that includes a serial-numbered item, if a quantity was specified in purchase units that differ from the base units, the system will perform quantity conversion to the base units and will generate a serial number for each base unit of the product. To generate the serial numbers and to view the generated serial numbers, invoke the '''Allocations''' dialog box on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_00|Purchase Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) form. {br}

As an example of unit conversion, imagine that you enter a purchase receipt for a case of serialized items for which the base unit is ''PIECE'', and the purchase unit is ''BOX'', which includes 10 ''PIECES''. For the item, on receipt, the system will generate 10 serial numbers. 
==Tracking Serial Numbers on Sales Orders==
When the items with the ''When Received'' assignment method are sold, their serial numbers must be specified in a sales order. When you enter a sales order with a serialized stock item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the particular units will be selected in accordance with the issue method selected for the lot/serial class of the stock item. To select the serial numbers, open the '''Allocations ''' dialog box on the '''Document Details''' tab of this form. {br}

For stock items with the ''When Used'' assignment method, the serial numbers must be specified when the items are listed on the sales order. Depending on the item&rsquo;s lot/serial class, you can manually enter the numbers or generate them. To enter or to generate the serial numbers and to view the serial numbers, invoke the '''Allocations''' dialog box on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form. ((({S:Hint}To enable tracking of serial numbers from vendor to customer, for items with the ''When Used'' assignment method you can configure the lot/serial class so that the manufacturer&rsquo;s serial numbers can be assigned directly as serial numbers. 
)))
If an item with the serial number assigned on issue (with the ''When Used'' assignment method) is returned by a customer, the item can be issued again with the same serial number.((({S:Hint}When you enter a vendor return, the unit of measure that appears by default is the purchase UOM (unit of the measure) if the purchase UOM was defined for the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, and you must specify the particular serial numbers of each returned base UOM.
)))
==Tracking Expiration Dates==
 Acumatica ERP provides the ability to track the expiration date for each lot and serial number. The expiration date is specified on receipt of the items, and the same date is assigned to all items of a lot. The expiration date can be assigned to each item with a serial number individually. For a lot/serial class whose items are tracked by expiration dates, you can select the ''Expiration'' issue method to automatically issue items with the earliest expiration dates, thus minimizing losses. {br}

For the inventory items with tracked expiration dates, the quantity of expired items is calculated automatically. The quantities of expired inventory can be monitored with the help of reports and inquiries, so you can promptly discard the expired items. 
==Tracking Inventory by Using Inquiries and Reports ==
The inquiry forms and reports in the Inventory module, listed below, provide various information about the lot/serial numbers, so that you can view how the item is allocated, and you can easily locate any item by its lot or serial number: 
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_70_00|Inventory Lot/Serial History] ([~/?ScreenId=IN407000|IN407000]): Use this form to find the required item's location by the lot or serial number assigned.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]): Use this form to view how the item is allocated: the quantities at specific locations, on sales orders and purchase orders, and in transit between warehouses.
*[HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_30_00|Lot/Serial Numbers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN613000|IN613000]): Use this report to view the list of items (with their specific lot or serial numbers) located at the selected warehouse or particular location.

For items with the  When Received  assignment method, the item's specific units 				are picked in accordance with the issue method assigned to the item's lot/serial 				class as follows:  FIFO : The units with the earliest receipt dates will be selected for the 					order. LIFO : The units with the latest receipt dates will be selected for the 					order. Expiration : The units with the earliest expiration dates will be selected 					for the order. Sequential : The units from the top of the list (with lot numbers ordered 					sequentially) will be selected for the order. Custom : The units with lot numbers you manually select will be used for 					the order. If the sales unit is smaller than the base unit for an item tracked by lot number 				(that is, the base unit consists of several sales units), the item may be sold in 				fractional quantities with the specified lot number.  Assigning Serial Numbers on Receipts With serialized inventory (inventory items with serial numbers), you can maintain the 				history of any serial number, track its costs and find the customer in case of 				recall.  For stock items with serial numbers, the base unit should be the smallest unit of 				measure used for the item; in such cases, the same unit is used as the purchase 				unit, sales unit, and the base unit.  To enable tracking of serial numbers from vendor to customer, for 				items with the  When Received  method, you can configure the serial numbers so 				that one of the segments of serial numbers can be used for these manufacturer's 				numbers.   When you enter a purchase receipt that includes a serial-numbered item, if a 				quantity was specified in purchase units that differ from the base units, the system 				will perform quantity conversion to the base units and will generate a serial number 				for each base unit of the product. To generate the serial numbers and to view the 				generated serial numbers, invoke the  Allocations  dialog box on the 					 Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302000|PO302000]) Purchase Receipts 				(PO302000) form.  As an example of unit conversion, imagine that you enter a purchase receipt for a 				case of serialized items for which the base unit is  PIECE , and the purchase 				unit is  BOX , which includes 10  PIECES . For the item, on receipt, the 				system will generate 10 serial numbers.  Tracking Serial Numbers on Sales Orders When the items with the  When Received  assignment method are sold, their serial 				numbers must be specified in a sales order. When you enter a sales order with a 				serialized stock item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders 				(SO301000) form, the particular units will be selected in accordance with the 				issue method selected for the lot/serial class of the stock item. To select the 				serial numbers, open the  Allocations   dialog box on the  Document 					Details  tab of this form.  For stock items with the  When Used  assignment method, the serial numbers must 				be specified when the items are listed on the sales order. Depending on the item's 				lot/serial class, you can manually enter the numbers or generate them. To enter or 				to generate the serial numbers and to view the serial numbers, invoke the 					 Allocations  dialog box on the  Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form.  To enable tracking of serial numbers from vendor to customer, for 				items with the  When Used  assignment method you can configure the lot/serial 				class so that the manufacturer's serial numbers can be assigned directly as serial 				numbers.  If an item with the serial number assigned on issue (with the  When Used  				assignment method) is returned by a customer, the item can be issued again with the 				same serial number. When you enter a vendor return, the unit of measure that appears by default is the 				purchase UOM (unit of the measure) if the purchase UOM was defined for the item on 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form, and you must specify the particular serial 				numbers of each returned base UOM. Tracking Expiration Dates  Acumatica ERP provides the ability to track the expiration date for each lot and serial number. 				The expiration date is specified on receipt of the items, and the same date is 				assigned to all items of a lot. The expiration date can be assigned to each item 				with a serial number individually. For a lot/serial class whose items are tracked by 				expiration dates, you can select the  Expiration  issue method to automatically 				issue items with the earliest expiration dates, thus minimizing losses.  For the inventory items with tracked expiration dates, the quantity of expired items is 				calculated automatically. The quantities of expired inventory can be monitored with 				the help of reports and inquiries, so you can promptly discard the expired items.  Tracking Inventory by Using Inquiries and Reports  The inquiry forms and reports in the Inventory module, listed below, provide various 				information about the lot/serial numbers, so that you can view how the item is 				allocated, and you can easily locate any item by its lot or serial number:   ([~/?ScreenId=IN407000|IN407000]) Inventory Lot/Serial History (IN407000): Use this form to find the 					required item's location by the lot or serial number assigned.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000): Use this form to 					view how the item is allocated: the quantities at specific locations, on sales 					orders and purchase orders, and in transit between warehouses.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN613000|IN613000]) Lot/Serial Numbers (IN613000): Use this report to 					view the list of items (with their specific lot or serial numbers) located at 					the selected warehouse or particular location.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
For peak efficiency, manufacturing and merchandising companies need to precisely track the types and quantities of items of every type stored in inventory. Acumatica ERP provides flexible tools for identifying and tracking various types of such items.{br}{TOC}
==Inventory IDs==
Each inventory item is tracked in the system by its inventory ID. This unique identifier can be just a number, or you can configure it to provide basic information about the item type, brand, or use. Well-designed inventory IDs can help you sort and group items for reports. {br}

As with other identifiers in Acumatica ERP, inventory IDs can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. Identifiers for stock and non-stock items are configured using the same segmented key: ''INVENTORY''. For the key, you can define how many segments it will have, what values may be used, whether they should be validated, or whether auto-numbering should be used for generating inventory IDs. To have inventory IDs automatically generated on creating new inventory items, you can configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key as having a single segment with the '''Auto-Number''' option selected for this segment and a numbering sequence specified in the '''Numbering ID''' box. If you have a restricted number of possible items and the users will enter arbitrary inventory IDs manually, you can configure the ''INVENTORY'' key as having a single segment with non-validated values. If the type of items should be indicated by their IDs, consider configuring the ''INVENTORY'' key with two segments, for one of which you create a list of pre-defined values.{br}

When configuring the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key, decide whether you will use alternate IDs for stock and non-stock items. With alternate IDs (item identifiers used by vendors and customer of the items), the users will be able to specify items by typing their alternate IDs as well as inventory IDs in the '''Inventory ID''' boxes on sales and purchase orders without errors. For more information on using alternate IDs and on how to configure the ''INVENTORY'' segmented key in this case, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Cross-References|Item Cross-References].{br}

If required, you can change the inventory ID for any non-stock or stock item manually by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Change ID''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, respectively, and by specifying another inventory ID in a dialog box that opens.
==Subitem Codes==
In addition to inventory IDs, Acumatica ERP supports subitems (or subitem codes), which can be useful for otherwise-identical products that have different colors, sizes, or other properties tracked because they are important to customers. Thus, under the same inventory ID, you may have a number of subitems—products that share all the settings of the inventory record but have additional properties that differ, such as size or color. {br}

You decide whether to use subitems on a system-wide level, based on the particular products you stock. If products with differing properties represent a small part of all products stocked in your warehouse, you can assign individual inventory IDs to each product variation. If such products represent a significant percentage of all stock, you may want to save the effort of creating and maintaining inventory records for each variation and instead use subitems, each with a subitem code. See below for a simplified example of subitems in use. ((({S:Hint}If subitems are enabled, subitem codes should be used with every stock item, even if an item has no variations. Make sure to add for each subitem segment values that mean ''no variations''.
)))
==Example of Using Subitems==
Suppose the merchandise sold by your company is men&rsquo;s apparel: T-shirts, shoes, and socks. While each model of T-shirts, shoes, and socks has a different inventory ID, the ID offers no information about the material used, the color, and the size. If you used a different ID for every possible permutation of size, color, and material, it would significantly increase the number of IDs in use and would require a significant effort to enter all those inventory records. {br}

Suppose that your men&rsquo;s apparel company stocks and sells only three products with the following properties. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" !  Product Type
!width="30%" ! Color
!width="20%" ! Size
!width="30%" ! Fabric/Material
|- 
|  T-Shirt
| Yellow, White, or Red
| S, M, L, XL, or XXL
| Cotton or Viscose
|- 
|  Socks
| Black
| 6, 7, 8, or 9
| Polyester
|- 
|  Shoes
| Black, Brown, or White
| 38, 39, 40, 42, 42, or 43
| Nubuck or Leather
|}
For all types of products at the warehouse, we break down all the properties—such as color, size, and fabric or material—that split the products into subitems and all possible values of these properties as shown in the table below. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" !  Property
!width="80%" ! Property Values 
|- 
|  Color
| Yellow, White, Red, Black, Brown 
|- 
|  Size
| S, M, L, XL, XXL , 6, 7, 8, 9, 38, 39, 40, 42, 42, 43 
|- 
|  Material
| Nubuck, Leather, Polyester, Cotton, Viscose 
|}
You would then design the subitem code. It can be segmented, with each segment describing a specific property. For the above example, we could create a subitem code that consists of the following three segments: color, size, and material. {br}

Imagine if you added soap (with the inventory ID ''SOAP'') to this merchandise; the soap has only one size and one &ldquo;signature&ldquo; scent. The color, size, and material properties, then, do not apply to soap. For products without specific properties, you need non-specific values (those that mean &ldquo;not applicable&ldquo;) for the respective segments. We recommend that you use similar non-specific values for all segments, such as zero values or ''N/A'' strings. In this example, we could use ''000'', ''000'', and ''0000000000'' for color, size, and material, respectively. {br}

By using these properties, you can describe variations of all product subitems. The subitem code consists of the following possible values for the specified three segments.
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="14%" !  Segment
!width="14%" ! Property
!width="14%" ! Length
!width="57%" ! Segment Values 
|- 
|  1
| Color
| 3
|  000, YLW, WHT, RED, BLK, BRN
|- 
|  2
| Size
| 3
|  000, S&#95;;&#95;;, M&#95;;&#95;;, L&#95;;&#95;;, XL&#95;;, XXL , &#95;;&#95;;6, &#95;;&#95;;7, &#95;;&#95;;8, &#95;;&#95;;9, &#95;;38, &#95;;39, &#95;;40, &#95;;42, &#95;;42, &#95;;43
|- 
|  3
| Material
| 9
|  000000000, Nubuck, Leather, Polyester, Cotton, Viscose
|}
Thus, we have the following subitems: 
*For the ''SHOES'' inventory ID: ''BLK-038-LEATHER'', ''BRN-038-NUBUCK'', ''BLK-039-LEATHER'', ''BRN-038-LEATHER'', and so forth, with 36 total subitems
*For the ''TSHIRT'' inventory ID: ''YLW-S&#95;;&#95;;-COTTON'','' YLW-XL&#95;;-COTTON'', ''YLW-XXL-COTTON'', and so forth, with 36 total subitems
*For the ''SOCKS'' inventory ID: ''BLK-&#95;;&#95;;8-POLYESTER'', ''BLK-&#95;;10-POLYESTER'', and so forth, with 6 total subitems
*For the ''SOAP'' inventory ID: ''000-000-000000000'' (the only subitem)

==Implementation of Subitems==
Subitems allow you to use the same inventory ID with all financial, warehousing, and processing settings for multiple variations of an item. Subitem codes are used in addition to inventory IDs. If you decide to use subitems, subitem codes must be used with each inventory ID, even if the product does not have variations (as with soap in the above example). {br}

Once subitems are enabled in the system, users need to enter a subitem code for every inventory transaction in the Inventory, Purchase Orders, and Sales Orders modules. When entering a subitem code for an item on any document, users browse through the possible values of each segment. {br}

By default, the subitem code is independent of inventory items and the system permits all combinations between them, although most combinations make no sense. For example, the inventory item ''SOAP'' does not actually have the subitem ''MGT-XXL-Polyester'', and the inventory item ''SOCKS'' doesn&rsquo;t have the valid subitem ''YLW-42-NUBUCK''. ((({S:Hint}For user reference, you can maintain the list of valid subitems on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_50_00|Subitems] ([~/?ScreenId=IN205000|IN205000]) form.
)))
==Configuration of Subitems in Your System==
To configure subitems in your system, perform the following general steps: [anchor|#ol_wzv_2f2_rj]
#To use subitems in the system, enable the ''Inventory Subitems'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
#:((({S:Warn}Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled. 
)))
#Define the segmented structure of subitems by using the ''INSUBITEM'' key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form.
#Add values for each subitem segment by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) form.
#Create stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.
#On the '''Cross-References''' tab, assign to each inventory ID-subitem pair alternate IDs, if such IDs are used by vendors or customers.
#By using the '''Restriction Groups''' tab of this form, assign the item to appropriate subitem restriction groups.

==Subitem Cost Calculation Options==
Products with different inventory IDs are always costed separately. Products with the same inventory ID and different subitem codes can be costed as one item or as several items. For each subitem segment defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] form, the '''Include in Cost''' check box controls how cost will be calculated: 
*If the check box is selected, costs of products with the same inventory ID and different values in this subitem segment are calculated as if for different items.
*If the check box is cleared, in cost calculations, items with different segment values in their subitems will be considered as one item. In this case, the segment should have one value marked as aggregating value on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_30_00|Segment Values] form. The cost will be shown for the item with the subitem that has this aggregating value in the segment.

Add values for each subitem segment by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) Segment Values (CS203000) form. Create stock items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items 					(IN202500) form. On the  Cross-References  tab, assign to each inventory ID-subitem pair 					alternate IDs, if such IDs are used by vendors or customers. By using the  Restriction Groups  tab of this form, assign the item to 					appropriate subitem restriction groups. Subitem Cost Calculation Options Products with different inventory IDs are always costed separately. Products with the 				same inventory ID and different subitem codes can be costed as one item or as 				several items. For each subitem segment defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys form, the  Include in Cost  check box controls how cost will be calculated:  If the check box is selected, costs of products with the same inventory ID and 					different values in this subitem segment are calculated as if for different 					items. If the check box is cleared, in cost calculations, items with different segment 					values in their subitems will be considered as one item. In this case, the 					segment should have one value marked as aggregating value on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS203000|CS203000]) Segment Values form. The cost will be shown for the item with the 					subitem that has this aggregating value in the segment.

Inventory transactions are used to account for inventory items moved to or from a specific warehouse, between locations within a warehouse, or between warehouses.{br}

Purchases and sales cause inventory item movements, and the respective inventory transactions are generated by documents, such as purchase receipts and sales orders, originated in other modules. Your company may also have direct inventory transactions—those not based on purchase or sales documents—such as issue transactions to remove damaged or expired goods from inventory. Because direct transactions are not standard operations, they should be accompanied by reason codes that supply offset accounts and subaccounts and explain why these transactions were performed.{br}

This topic contains an overview of the inventory processes and processing options applicable to documents of all types.{br}{TOC}
==Types of Inventory Transactions==
You use the following documents to record the inventory transactions performed:[anchor|#ul_zr1_gd2_rj]
*'''Receipt''': To record the arrival of some quantity of stock items to the inventory. Generally, inventory receipts are generated in the process of releasing purchase and transfer receipts, and inventory receipts can be created manually. For more details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Receipt_Processing|Inventory Receipt Processing]. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form, you can enter inventory receipts manually and view all the receipts that have been created in the system.
*'''Issue''': To record the withdrawal of some quantity of stock items from the inventory. Generally, inventory issues are generated in the process of shipment confirmation, but also can be created directly in Inventory. By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form, you can enter inventory issues manually and view all the issues that have been created in the system. For more details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Issue_Processing|Inventory Issue Processing].
*'''Adjustment''': To update the quantity of stock items in the warehouse (usually after physical inventory counts) and to update costs for items with standard cost and other valuation methods. By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form, you can enter inventory adjustments manually and view all the adjustments that have been created in the system. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Enter_Inventory_Adjustment|To Enter an Inventory Adjustment].
*'''Transfer''': To record the movement of stock items between locations within a warehouse or between warehouses. For more details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Transfer_Processing|Inventory Transfer Processing].
*'''Kit Assembly''': To update the quantities of kits that were assembled and items that were used as kit components. If a kit is a stock item, this transaction increases the on-hand quantity of kits and decreases the on-hand quantity of its stock item components (if any). The cost of the assembled kit may exceed the total cost of its components if includes the cost of labor or other extra costs, added as non-stock item components. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Accounting_for_Kits|Inventory Item Kits].
*'''Kit Disassembling''': To update the quantities of kits and their stock components when kits are disassembled into components. If a kit is a stock item, this transaction decreases the on-hand quantity of kits and increases the on-hand quantity of stock components (if any). The system generates an inventory adjustment to account for the extra costs that incur in the process of disassembling, if any. 

==Currency of the Inventory Documents==
For all inventory documents, the base currency is used. Even if the original documents in the Purchase Orders or Sales Orders modules were created in foreign currencies, the inventory documents generated for them are always in the base currency.
==Data Entry Options==
The settings that can be used to manage the data entry of inventory documents are located on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]).{br}

When a new inventory document is created, the system assigns it a reference number according to the numbering sequence specified for documents of this type in the '''Numbering Settings''' section of the form.{br}

You can select the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box to make ''On Hold'' the default status. Then on saving, a new inventory document will get the ''On Hold'' status. To save it in another status, the user will need to clear the '''Hold''' check box.{br}

To reduce the input error rate, you can select the '''Validate Document Totals on Entry''' check box. Then, the user will need to review the document and enter manually the control quantity as a value that is equal to the document quantity and control amount as a value that is equal to the document amount. {br}

To make data entry for receiving operations more efficient with the help of barcode scanners, select the '''Automatically Add Receipt Line for Barcode''' check box to enable adding a line to receipt each time a new barcode has been scanned or entered manually. {br}

Also, you can select the '''Add One Unit Per Barcode''' check box to indicate to the system that the item quantity on the receipt should be increased by one unit each time the item&rsquo;s barcode is entered into the system, manually or by using a barcode scanner.
==Statuses==
An inventory transaction can pass through the following statuses:[anchor|#ul_t3b_tqc_2v]
*''On Hold'': The transaction is a draft and may require further editing. With this status, the transaction cannot be released. If the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form, the system assigns the ''On Hold'' status to new inventory transactions by default. To change the status of the transaction, you need to clear the '''Hold''' check box and save the transaction.
*''Balanced'': This is the default status for new transactions if the '''Hold Documents on Entry''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form. The transaction still can be edited and can be released. If the '''Validate Document Totals on Entry''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form, you must enter the control quantity and control amount to save the transaction in this status.
*''Released'': The transaction has been released and cannot be edited. Releasing the transaction updates the availability data. 

==Releasing Options==
You can release inventory transactions one-by-one using the appropriate form: [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]). In addition, you can release multiple inventory transactions by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_10_00|Release IN Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) form. {br}

You can select the '''Update GL''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form to enable posting of the transactions generated in the Inventory module to the general ledger. If the check box is cleared, the system doesn't generate GL transactions on release of inventory documents and the general ledger will not be updated by the inventory documents.{br}

Upon release, the system takes the following actions:[anchor|#ul_wlz_lw4_3v]
*Updates the availability data according to the transaction type of each line.
*Updates the cost statistics for each item.
*If the updating of the general ledger is enabled, generates the general ledger transactions according to the transaction type of each line. You can view the balance of each inventory account and the list of documents (that updates the account) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) form. 

==Posting Options==
The settings that can be used to manage the posting process for inventory documents are located on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]). ((({S:Hint}You may need to temporarily clear the check box before you start import of historical inventory documents if you do not want them to affect the balances of GL accounts.
)))
The system assigns the batch numbers according to the numbering sequence selected in the '''Batch Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. The system immediately posts the GL transactions if the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check box is selected.{br}

Also, you can use the '''Post Summary on Updating GL''' check box to control how transactions are posted. If you use the GL accounts that allow posting of summary values, you can select this check box. Then, the transactions in the batches will be grouped by account and subaccount pair and only the sum for each pair will be posted.
==Transaction Reason Codes==
You use reason codes, defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) form, to indicate why direct inventory transactions are made. Each reason code has a default account and subaccount specified that are used as the offset account and subaccount for the inventory transactions. You can specify the reason codes to be used as the default reason codes for inventory receipts, issues, and adjustments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.

This topic contains an overview of the inventory processes and processing options                 applicable to documents of all types. Types of Inventory Transactions You use the following documents to record the inventory transactions performed: Receipt : To record the arrival of some quantity of stock items to the                     inventory. Generally, inventory receipts are generated in the process of                     releasing purchase and transfer receipts, and inventory receipts can be created                     manually. For more details, see  Inventory Receipt Processing.                     On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000) form, you can enter inventory                     receipts manually and view all the receipts that have been created in the                     system. Issue : To record the withdrawal of some quantity of stock items from the                     inventory. Generally, inventory issues are generated in the process of shipment                     confirmation, but also can be created directly in Inventory. By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form, you can enter inventory issues                     manually and view all the issues that have been created in the system. For more                     details, see  Inventory Issue Processing. Adjustment : To update the quantity of stock items in the warehouse                     (usually after physical inventory counts) and to update costs for items with                     standard cost and other valuation methods. By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments (IN303000) form, you can enter inventory                     adjustments manually and view all the adjustments that have been created in the                      system .                     For details, see  To Enter an Inventory Adjustment. Transfer : To record the movement of stock items between locations within                     a warehouse or between warehouses. For more details, see  Inventory Transfer Processing. Kit Assembly : To update the quantities of kits that were assembled and                     items that were used as kit components. If a kit is a stock item, this                     transaction increases the on-hand quantity of kits and decreases the on-hand                     quantity of its stock item components (if any). The cost of the assembled kit                     may exceed the total cost of its components if includes the cost of labor or                     other extra costs, added as non-stock item components. For more information, see                          Inventory Item Kits. Kit Disassembling : To update the quantities of kits and their stock                     components when kits are disassembled into components. If a kit is a stock item,                     this transaction decreases the on-hand quantity of kits and increases the                     on-hand quantity of stock components (if any). The system generates an inventory                     adjustment to account for the extra costs that incur in the process of                     disassembling, if any.  Currency of the Inventory Documents For all inventory documents, the base currency is used. Even if the original                 documents in the Purchase Orders or Sales Orders modules were created in foreign                 currencies, the inventory documents generated for them are always in the base                 currency. Data Entry Options The settings that can be used to manage the data entry of inventory documents are                 located on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000). When a new inventory document is created, the system assigns it a reference number                 according to the numbering sequence specified for documents of this type in the                      Numbering Settings  section of the form. You can select the  Hold Documents on Entry  check box to make                      On Hold  the default status. Then on saving, a new inventory document will                 get the  On Hold  status. To save it in another status, the user will need to                 clear the  Hold  check box. To reduce the input error rate, you can select the  Validate Document                     Totals on Entry  check box. Then, the user will need to review the                 document and enter manually the control quantity as a value that is equal to the                 document quantity and control amount as a value that is equal to the document                 amount.  To make data entry for receiving operations more efficient with the help of barcode                 scanners, select the  Automatically Add Receipt Line for Barcode  check box to                 enable adding a line to receipt each time a new barcode has been scanned or entered                 manually.  Also, you can select the  Add One Unit Per Barcode  check box to                 indicate to the system that the item quantity on the receipt should be increased by                 one unit each time the item's barcode is entered into the system, manually or by                 using a barcode scanner. Statuses An inventory transaction can pass through the following statuses: On Hold : The transaction is a draft and may require further editing. With                     this status, the transaction cannot be released. If the  Hold                         Documents on Entry  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form, the system assigns the  On                         Hold  status to new inventory transactions by default. To change the                     status of the transaction, you need to clear the  Hold                      check box and save the transaction. Balanced : This is the default status for new transactions if the                          Hold Documents on Entry  check box is cleared on the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences form. The transaction still can be edited                     and can be released. If the  Validate Document Totals on                         Entry  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences form, you must enter the control quantity and control amount to save the                     transaction in this status. Released : The transaction has been released and cannot be edited.                     Releasing the transaction updates the availability data.  Releasing Options You can release inventory transactions one-by-one using the appropriate form:   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000)   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts (IN301000),                 or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments (IN303000). In addition, you can release multiple                 inventory transactions by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) Release IN Documents (IN501000) form.  You can select the  Update GL  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences form to enable posting of the transactions generated                 in the Inventory module to the general ledger. If the check box is cleared, the                 system doesn't generate GL transactions on release of inventory documents and the                 general ledger will not be updated by the inventory documents. Upon release, the system takes the following actions: Updates the availability data according to the transaction type of each                     line. Updates the cost statistics for each item. If the updating of the general ledger is enabled, generates the general ledger                     transactions according to the transaction type of each line. You can view the                     balance of each inventory account and the list of documents (that updates the                     account) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account (IN403000) form.  Posting Options The settings that can be used to manage the posting process for inventory documents                 are located on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000).  You may need to temporarily clear the check box before you start import of                 historical inventory documents if you do not want them to affect the balances of GL                 accounts. The system assigns the batch numbers according to the numbering sequence selected in                 the  Batch Numbering Sequence  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. The system immediately posts the GL                 transactions if the  Automatically Post on Release  check box                 is selected. Also, you can use the  Post Summary on Updating GL  check box to control how                 transactions are posted. If you use the GL accounts that allow posting of summary                 values, you can select this check box. Then, the transactions in the batches will be                 grouped by account and subaccount pair and only the sum for each pair will be                 posted. Transaction Reason Codes You use reason codes, defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) Reason Codes                 (CS211000) form, to indicate why direct inventory transactions are made. Each reason                 code has a default account and subaccount specified that are used as the offset                 account and subaccount for the inventory transactions.

Inventory receipts, which you can create and view by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form, are used to account for stock items received in the inventory. If your organization uses the Purchase Orders module, the system creates inventory receipts automatically once purchase receipts have been released.{br}

Also, you can create inventory receipts not linked to purchases in the following situations:[anchor|#ul_gc5_c2b_dv]
*To enter initial quantities of stock items during the system implementation
*To record the items transferred to the destination warehouses from the source warehouses

If the Purchase Orders module is not used, or in some other cases, you can create inventory receipts manually to account for the stock items purchased and received to inventory.{br}{TOC}
==Data Entry==
You can view, edit, and create inventory receipts by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. A new inventory receipt, either automatically generated or created manually, is assigned a reference number according to the numbering sequence that is specified in the '''Receipt / Transfer Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.{br}

For manually created receipts, you enter the following information for each line:[anchor|#ul_qpy_mh4_3v]
*'''Inventory ID''' that identifies the stock item. If the ''Inventory Subitems'' feature is enabled in your system, subitem is used with the inventory ID to identify the stock item.
*'''UOM''', unit of measure. By default, it is the base UOM selected for the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. However, if the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can use any of the UOMs specified for the item.
*'''Quantity''', the quantity of the item to be received to the inventory in the selected UOM.
*'''Unit Cost''' or '''Ext. Cost''' (extended cost) of the received item. You can enter the unit cost or use the default unit cost, and the system calculates the extended cost automatically as the unit cost multiplied by quantity. Or, you can enter the extended cost. The default unit cost specified for a stock item on a receipt is an estimation of actual cost retrieved from cost statistics at the moment when the item is selected for a line. Later, on release of the receipt, the system applies the correct cost according to the valuation method selected for the item.
*'''Reason Code''', which is required only for manually entered receipts. A reason code supplies the offset account and subaccount (to be credited) by the receipt-based batch of transactions. The system will use the default reason code selected for receipts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form if no reason code is specified for the line. Reason codes are not used for receipts generated from the documents originated in the Purchase Orders module.

An item can be added to a receipt with the help of a barcode scanner. Scanning a new barcode automatically adds a new line to the receipt and scanning the same barcode adds one more unit of the item. The options that control this behavior are located on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form.{br}

For the procedure that describes hot to enter inventory receipts, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Enter_IN_Receipt|To Enter an Inventory Receipt].
==Release of Receipts==
You can release a particular inventory receipt by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. Also, you can release multiple receipts (along with inventory transactions of other types) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_10_00|Release IN Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) form. {br}

Released receipts are read-only documents.{br}

If the '''Update GL''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form, on release of each receipt the system generates a batch of general ledger entries, updates the availability data for the items and the cost statistics. You can view the reference number of such batch on the Financial Details tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] form: To view the details of the batch, click the reference number of the batch in the '''Batch Nbr''' box.{br}

The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) report shows the on-hand quantity and the total cost of inventory items on hand, which are updated by every released inventory receipt.
==Processing of Receipts Generated by Purchases==
If a receipt is created automatically as the result of releasing a purchase receipt, the information required to post transactions listed in automatically generated inventory receipts comes from the posting class of the item. Posting classes are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form and assigned to stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] and to non-stock items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] form.{br}

When an inventory receipt based on a purchase receipt is released, the item&rsquo;s posting class determines the General Ledger accounts to be updated. Reason codes are not used for receipts generated from the Purchase Orders module.{br}

On release of a receipt, the system generates a batch of General Ledger entries: For each receipt&rsquo;s line, one journal entry debits the inventory account and another one credits the PO accrual account (determined by the posting class of the item). 
==Processing of Manually Entered Receipts==
You can create inventory receipts manually if your organization does not use the Purchase Orders and Sales Orders modules. In case the Sales Orders module is integrated with the Inventory module, you can create receipts for the transferred inventory in a two-step transfer process. Also, you can use receipts to enter initial quantities of stock items during the system implementation.{br}

On release of a receipt, the system generates a batch of General Ledger entries: For each receipt&rsquo;s line, one journal entry debits the inventory account (determined by the posting class of the item) and another credits the account specified in the reason code of the receipt line.
==Printing Labels==
After you have processed the receipt, you can print labels for the received items by clicking '''Reports''' > '''Inventory Item Labels''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form. You can also print labels later by running the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_92_00|Inventory Item Labels] ([~/?ScreenId=IN619200|IN619200]) report. {br}

A label for a stock item includes the name of the warehouse, the location where this item is stored, the inventory ID, subitem, description, and information about receipt (the reference number and the date). If the lot/serial numbers are assigned to the item on receipt, separate labels are generated for each serial or lot number used for the received quantity of the item.

Inventory issues allow your organization to track stock levels at warehouses. If your organization uses the Sales Orders module, Acumatica ERP automatically generates inventory issues upon release of sales orders, customer returns, credit and debit memos, and kit assembly documents. {br}

Also, you can create inventory issues that are not linked to sales in the following situations: [anchor|#ul_gc5_c2b_dv]
*To remove expired or damaged goods
*To return excessively issued goods

If the Sales Orders module is not used, or in some other cases, you can create inventory issues to account for sales and returns.{br}{TOC}
==Types of Issue Lines==
Inventory issues may decrease or increase inventory, depending on the transaction type of the issue lines.{br}

The following transaction types are available for issues:[anchor|#ul_x53_vq4_3v]
*''Issue'': Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued from inventory. Transactions of this type are generated from the purchase returns and can be created directly in the Inventory module to account for expired goods. The quantities of stock items on the issues of this type decrease the on-hand quantities of these items and decrease the total costs of the items in inventory by the amount specified in the '''Ext. Cost''' box.
*''Return'': Indicates that the specified quantity of the stock item was returned to inventory. Transactions of this type are generated from customer return orders of the ''RM'' and ''RR'' order types. Issues of this type can be created to return the excessively issued items. The quantities of returned items increase the on-hand quantities of stock items and the total costs.
*''Invoice'': Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued based on an invoice. Generally, the system generates issues of this type when you are fulfilling the sales orders; also, you can create these issues manually. The quantity of inventory in this transaction will be subtracted from the quantity of the item available at the warehouse. 
*:((({S:Hint}If the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system generates issues of the ''Invoice'' type on release of the direct sales invoices. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_scn_Direct_Sale|Processing Direct Sales and Returns].
)))
*''Debit Memo'': Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued from inventory; the system generates transactions of this type of transaction on release of the appropriate documents. The quantity of the item in this transaction will be deducted from the on-hand quantity of the item. Transactions of this type can also be entered manually. 
*''Credit Memo'': Indicates that the specified quantity of the stock item is received to inventory; transactions of this type are generated by the system during the processing of customer returns of the ''RC (Return for Credit)'' type and can be entered manually. The quantity of the item in this transaction increases the on-hand quantity. 
*:((({S:Hint}If the ''Advanced SO Invoices'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system generates issues of the ''Credit Memo'' type on release of the direct sales invoices with return lines. For more information, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_scn_Direct_Sale|Processing Direct Sales and Returns].
)))

==Data Entry==
You can view, edit, and create inventory issues by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. A new inventory issue, whether automatically generated or created manually, is assigned a reference number according to the numbering sequence that is specified in the '''Issue Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.{br}

For each line of a new issue, you enter the following information:[anchor|#ul_qpy_mh4_3v]
*'''Tran. Type''', which determines how the issue updates the ending inventory and which general ledger transactions are generated. 
*'''Inventory ID''', which identifies the stock item. If the ''Inventory Subitems'' feature is enabled in your system, the subitem is used with the inventory ID to identify the stock item.
*'''UOM''', or the unit of measure. By default, the system inserts the base UOM selected for the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. However, if the ''Multiple Units of Measure'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can use any of the UOMs specified for the item.
*'''Quantity''', the quantity of the item to be issued in the selected UOM.
*'''Unit Cost''' or '''Ext. Cost''' (extended cost) of the issued item. You can enter the unit cost or use the default unit cost, and the system calculates the extended cost automatically as the unit cost multiplied by quantity. Alternatively, you can enter the extended cost. The default unit cost specified for a stock item on a receipt is an estimation of the actual cost retrieved from cost statistics at the moment when the item is selected for a line. Later, on release of the receipt, the system applies the correct cost according to the valuation method selected for the item.
*'''Unit Price''' or '''Ext. Price''' (extended price) of the issued item, which is applicable only to lines of the ''Invoice'', ''Debit'', and ''Credit Memo'' types. You can enter the unit price or use the default unit price, and the system calculates the extended price automatically as the unit price multiplied by quantity. You can instead enter the extended price manually. 
*'''Reason Code''', which is required only for transactions of the ''Issue'' or ''Return'' types. The reason code defines the offset account to be updated by the issue line. The system will use the default reason code selected for issues on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form if no reason code is specified for the line. Reason codes are not used for issues generated from documents originating in the Sales Orders module.

For the procedures that describe how to enter an inventory issue, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Enter_Issue_of_Issue_Type|To Enter an Inventory Issue of the Issue Type] and [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Enter_Issue_of_Invoice_Type|To Enter an Inventory Issue of the Invoice Type].
==Release of Issues==
You can release a particular inventory issue by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form. Also, you can mass-release issues (along with inventory transactions of other types) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_10_00|Release IN Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) form.{br}

If the quantity specified for any of the inventory items in the issue is greater than the ''Available for Issue'' quantity for this item in the warehouse specified for the line that contains the item, the system will not release the issue. Also, if an inventory item is tracked by lot or serial numbers, the system checks whether the specified lot or serial numbers are available in the warehouse selected in the line.{br}

If the '''Update GL''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form, on release of each inventory issue, the system generates a batch of journal entries based on the types of transactions included in the issue, and updates the availability data for the items and the cost statistics. You can view the reference number of this batch on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] form: To view the details of the batch, click the reference number of the batch in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box.{br}

Released issues are read-only documents.{br}

The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) report shows the on-hand quantity and the total cost of inventory items on hand, which are updated by every released inventory issue.
==Issues Generated by Sales==
If an issue is created automatically as the result of a sales order being processed, the extended cost amount usually debits a cost of goods sold account and credits an inventory account, with the accounts determined by the posting class of the stock item. Reason codes are not used for issues generated from the Sales Orders module.{br}

The unit costs specified for stock items on inventory issues are the estimations of actual costs according to the cost statistics at the moment when each item is selected in the sales order line. On release of the inventory issue, the system calculates the correct costs of the goods sold based on the valuation methods assigned to the items.
==Direct Issues==
If you enter an issue manually, reason codes are required for each issue line of the ''Issue'' and ''Return'' types. Reason codes used for issues should provide offset accounts for each specific type of issues. You can specify the most appropriate reason code for each issue line; when no reason code is selected, the system automatically inserts the default reason code of the ''Issue'' usage that is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.{br}

With a direct issue, the extended cost amount updates the balances of the inventory account and of the offset account supplied by the reason code. The selected offset account depends on the reason of the transaction; it is a specific expense account. If the issue has been created for kit assembling, the offset account is usually an expense account, such as ''Material Expense''. If the issue has been created to remove expired goods, the offset account might be ''Expired Goods&rsquo; Costs''. {br}

For issue lines of the ''Invoice'', ''Credit Memo'', and ''Debit Memo'' types, you can specify the price and the extended price of the line item. ((({S:Hint}The '''Unit Price''' and '''Ext. Price''' values cannot be used for inventory issues of the ''Return'' and ''Issue'' types.
)))
On release of such transactions (with nonzero extended prices), the system generates the following additional journal entries:[anchor|#ol_jpg_lpq_2v]
*For a line of the ''Invoice'' type, the extended price amount (sales amount) is credited to the Sales account and debited to the AR Clearing account defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. 
*For a line of the ''Credit Memo'' or ''Debit Memo'' type, this amount is credited to the AR Clearing account and debited to the Sales account. The Sales account is determined by the posting class of the item; can be overridden by the offset account of the reason code it such code is specified. 

To complete the sale to the customer or the customer return, you can later create an appropriate AR document (''Invoice'', ''Credit Memo'', or ''Debit Memo'') by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, and move the sales amount from the AR Clearing account to the AR account of the customer.

The following transaction types are available for issues: Issue : Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued from           inventory. Transactions of this type are generated from the purchase returns and can be           created directly in the Inventory module to account for expired goods. The quantities of           stock items on the issues of this type decrease the on-hand quantities of these items and           decrease the total costs of the items in inventory by the amount specified in the              Ext. Cost  box. Return : Indicates that the specified quantity of the stock item was returned to           inventory. Transactions of this type are generated from customer return orders of the              RM  and  RR  order types. Issues of this type can be created to return the           excessively issued items. The quantities of returned items increase the on-hand quantities           of stock items and the total costs. Invoice : Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued           based on an invoice. Generally, the system generates issues of this type when you are           fulfilling the sales orders; also, you can create these issues manually. The quantity of           inventory in this transaction will be subtracted from the quantity of the item available           at the warehouse.  If the  Advanced SO Invoices  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features             (CS100000) form, the system generates issues of the  Invoice  type on release of             the direct sales invoices. For more information, see  Processing Direct Sales and Returns. Debit Memo : Indicates that the specified quantity of the inventory item is issued           from inventory; the system generates transactions of this type of transaction on release           of the appropriate documents. The quantity of the item in this transaction will be           deducted from the on-hand quantity of the item. Transactions of this type can also be           entered manually.            Credit Memo : Indicates that the specified quantity of the stock item is received           to inventory; transactions of this type are generated by the system during the processing           of customer returns of the  RC (Return for Credit)  type and can be entered manually.           The quantity of the item in this transaction increases the on-hand quantity.              If             the  Advanced SO Invoices  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features             (CS100000) form, the system generates issues of the  Credit Memo  type on release             of the direct sales invoices with return lines. For more information, see  Processing Direct Sales and Returns. Data Entry You can view, edit, and create inventory issues by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. A new inventory issue, whether automatically generated or         created manually, is assigned a reference number according to the numbering sequence that is         specified in the  Issue Numbering Sequence  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. For each line of a new issue, you enter the following information: Tran. Type , which determines how the issue updates the ending           inventory and which general ledger transactions are generated.  Inventory ID , which identifies the stock item. If the              Inventory Subitems  feature is enabled in your system, the subitem is used with           the inventory ID to identify the stock item. UOM , or the unit of measure. By default, the system inserts the           base UOM selected for the item on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. However, if           the  Multiple Units of Measure  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, you can use any of the UOMs specified for the           item. Quantity , the quantity of the item to be issued in the selected           UOM. Unit Cost  or  Ext. Cost  (extended cost) of           the issued item. You can enter the unit cost or use the default unit cost, and the system           calculates the extended cost automatically as the unit cost multiplied by quantity.           Alternatively, you can enter the extended cost. The default unit cost specified for a           stock item on a receipt is an estimation of the actual cost retrieved from cost statistics           at the moment when the item is selected for a line. Later, on release of the receipt, the           system applies the correct cost according to the valuation method selected for the           item. Unit Price  or  Ext. Price  (extended price)           of the issued item, which is applicable only to lines of the  Invoice ,  Debit ,           and  Credit Memo  types. You can enter the unit price or use the default unit price,           and the system calculates the extended price automatically as the unit price multiplied by           quantity. You can instead enter the extended price manually.  Reason Code , which is required only for transactions of the              Issue  or  Return  types. The reason code defines the offset account to be           updated by the issue line. The system will use the default reason code selected for issues           on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form if no reason code is specified for           the line. Reason codes are not used for issues generated from documents originating in the           Sales Orders module. For the procedures that describe how to enter an inventory issue, see  To Enter an Inventory Issue of the Issue Type and  To Enter an Inventory Issue of the Invoice Type. Release of Issues You can release a particular inventory issue by clicking  Release  on         the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form. Also,         you can mass-release issues (along with inventory transactions of other types) by using the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) Release IN Documents (IN501000) form. If the quantity specified for any of the inventory items in the issue is greater than the            Available for Issue  quantity for this item in the warehouse specified for the line         that contains the item, the system will not release the issue. Also, if an inventory item is         tracked by lot or serial numbers, the system checks whether the specified lot or serial         numbers are available in the warehouse selected in the line. If the  Update GL  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form, on release of each inventory issue, the system         generates a batch of journal entries based on the types of transactions included in the         issue, and updates the availability data for the items and the cost statistics. You can view         the reference number of this batch on the  Financial Details  tab of         the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues form: To view the details of the batch, click the         reference number of the batch in the  Batch Nbr.  box. Released issues are read-only documents. The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation (IN615500) report shows the on-hand quantity and the         total cost of inventory items on hand, which are updated by every released inventory         issue. Issues Generated by Sales If an issue is created automatically as the result of a sales order being processed, the         extended cost amount usually debits a cost of goods sold account and credits an inventory         account, with the accounts determined by the posting class of the stock item. Reason codes         are not used for issues generated from the Sales Orders module. The unit costs specified for stock items on inventory issues are the estimations of actual         costs according to the cost statistics at the moment when each item is selected in the sales         order line. On release of the inventory issue, the system calculates the correct costs of         the goods sold based on the valuation methods assigned to the items. Direct Issues If you enter an issue manually, reason codes are required for each issue line of the            Issue  and  Return  types. Reason codes used for issues should provide offset         accounts for each specific type of issues. You can specify the most appropriate reason code         for each issue line; when no reason code is selected, the system automatically inserts the         default reason code of the  Issue  usage that is specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. With a direct issue, the extended cost amount updates the balances of the inventory account         and of the offset account supplied by the reason code. The selected offset account depends         on the reason of the transaction; it is a specific expense account. If the issue has been         created for kit assembling, the offset account is usually an expense account, such as            Material Expense . If the issue has been created to remove expired goods, the offset         account might be  Expired Goods' Costs .  For issue lines of the  Invoice ,  Credit Memo , and  Debit Memo  types, you         can specify the price and the extended price of the line item.  The  Unit Price  and  Ext. Price  values         cannot be used for inventory issues of the  Return  and  Issue  types. On release of such transactions (with nonzero extended prices), the system generates the         following additional journal entries: For a line of the  Invoice  type, the extended price amount (sales amount) is           credited to the Sales account and debited to the AR Clearing account defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form.  For a line of the  Credit Memo  or  Debit Memo  type, this amount is credited           to the AR Clearing account and debited to the Sales account. The Sales account is           determined by the posting class of the item; can be overridden by the offset account of           the reason code it such code is specified.  To complete the sale to the customer or the customer return, you can later create an         appropriate AR document ( Invoice ,  Credit Memo , or  Debit Memo ) by using         the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) form, and move the sales amount from the AR         Clearing account to the AR account of the customer. ]]></column>

Your organization can use inventory transfers to record stock movements between warehouses or between locations within the same warehouse. If your organization uses the Sales Order module, Acumatica ERP automatically generates inventory transfers when transfer orders are released. However, you can directly (manually) create inventory transfers too. This article describes the processing options available for inventory transfers that are created directly in the Inventory module.{br}{TOC}
==Types of Transfers==
You can use transfers of the following types:[anchor|#ul_x53_vq4_3v]
*''Single-Step'': The goods are transferred from the source warehouse location to the destination warehouse location. Transfers of this type can also be used to record stock moving from one location to another within the same warehouse.
*''Two-Step'': The transfer operation is made in two steps: The goods are issued at a specific location in the source warehouse, and then they are received at another location in the destination warehouse. The In-Transit Account specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form is used to temporary record the cost of items in transit.

You can create, view, edit, and release inventory transfers by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form. A new inventory transfer—whether it is automatically generated or created manually, and whether it is single-step or two-step—is assigned a reference number according to the numbering sequence that is specified in the '''Transfer Numbering Sequence''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form.
==Single-Step Transfers==
For a single-step transfer, you must specify the following information on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] form:[anchor|#ul_gjn_fjp_nv]
*The source warehouse (in the '''Warehouse''' box).
*The destination warehouse (in the '''To Warehouse''' box). If the items will be moved within the same warehouse, select the same warehouse as the source warehouse.
*Information about the stock item to be moved: inventory ID, UOM, and quantity.
*Information about the source location and the destination location.

For more details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Perform_SS_Transfer|To Create a Single-Step Transfer].{br}

You can release a particular inventory transfer by clicking '''Release''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] form. Also, you can release the transfers (along with inventory transactions of other types) in bulk by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_10_00|Release IN Documents] ([~/?ScreenId=IN501000|IN501000]) form. {br}

When a transfer performed between locations within the same warehouse is released, the system updates the allocations and the availability data for the transferred items but does not change the item costs.((({S:Hint}No batch is generated for a single-step transfer that records item movement from one location to another within the same warehouse. 
)))
When a transfer performed between different warehouses is released, the system updates allocations and availability data, updates cost statistics, and generates a GL batch of the following transactions: [anchor|#ul_p4s_kfl_4v]
*''Inventory'' account: Cr, COGS amount
*''Inventory'' account: Dr, COGS amount

The Inventory account for each item is determined by the posting class of this item. There could be two different accounts associated with the warehouses involved in the transfer if ''Warehouse'' is selected in the '''Use Inventory/Accrual Account From''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_60_00|Posting Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206000|IN206000]) form. If the ''Subaccounts'' feature is enabled in your system, the subaccounts used for the batch are defined by the rule specified in the '''Combine Inventory/Accrual Sub. From''' box.{br}

The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) report shows the on-hand quantity and the total cost of the inventory items on hand in each warehouse. This data is updated by each released inventory transfer that involves two warehouses.
==Two-Step Transfers==
If a company has multiple warehouses located at significant distances from one another, moving stock items between warehouses may require some time. Thus, the costs of items in transit are recorded temporarily to the In-Transit account. When the items are received at the destination warehouse, their costs are transferred to the appropriate inventory account. {br}

For a two-step transfer, you must create both of the following documents:[anchor|#ol_o4y_c2g_4v]
#'''Transfer of the ''2-Step'' type''': You can create this document by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Perform_2S_Transfer|To Create a Two-Step Transfer].
#:When this inventory transfer is released, journal entries for the following GL accounts are created: [anchor|#ul_dzh_4py_nv]
#*''Inventory'' account: Cr, COGS amount
#*''In-Transit'' account: Dr, COGS amount
#:The In-Transit account is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. If the ''Subaccounts'' feature is enabled in your system, the In-Transit subaccount used for the batch is defined in the '''In-Transit Sub.''' box on the same form.
#:As a result, the '''On Hand Qty.''' of the items in the source warehouse has been decreased.
#'''Transfer Receipt''': Once the two-step transfer (the previous document) is released, you must create a receipt for this transfer on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_00|Receipts] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) form by selecting the transfer by its reference number in the '''Transfer Nbr.''' box. When you do, all the information about the transferred items will be added to the transfer receipt. 
#:When this transfer receipt is released, the system updates the item&rsquo;s availability data, updates cost statistics, and generates a batch of the following GL transactions: 
#*''In-Transit'' account: Cr, COGS amount
#*''Inventory'' account: Dr, COGS amount
#:You can view the reference number of this batch on the '''Financial Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_00|Transfers] form: To view the details of the batch, click the reference number of the batch in the '''Batch Nbr.''' box.

As the result of receipt being released, the '''On Hand Qty.''' of the items in the destination warehouse has been increased, as you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form.
==Cost Updating==
The costs the transferred items will have in the destination warehouse depend on the valuation methods assigned to the items. For items with the ''Average'' and ''Standard cost'' valuation methods, the cost of an item in the destination warehouse will be the same as at the cost of the item at the source warehouse. For an item with the ''FIFO'' or ''Specific'' valuation method, a transfer receipt creates a new cost layer with the transferred quantity of the item and with the number and date of this transfer receipt. For details, see the section below.
==An Example of Cost Updating for a FIFO Item ==
If a stock item with the ''FIFO'' valuation method was transferred from one warehouse to another, a new cost layer for the transferred quantity is created. The history of transactions in the table below illustrates what costs the transferred items will have in the destination warehouse.[anchor|#table_vsl_r22_4v]

Transfers of this type can also be used to record stock           moving from one location to another within the same warehouse. Two-Step : The transfer operation is made in two steps: The goods are issued at a           specific location in the source warehouse, and then they are received at another location           in the destination warehouse. The In-Transit Account specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form is used to temporary record the cost of items           in transit. You can create, view, edit, and release inventory transfers by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers (IN304000) form. A new inventory         transfer—whether it is automatically generated or created manually, and whether it is         single-step or two-step—is assigned a reference number according to the numbering         sequence that is specified in the  Transfer Numbering Sequence  box on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences form. Single-Step Transfers For a single-step transfer, you must specify the following information on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers form: The source warehouse (in the  Warehouse  box). The destination warehouse (in the  To Warehouse  box). If the items           will be moved within the same warehouse, select the same warehouse as the source           warehouse.

When a transfer performed between locations within the same warehouse is released, the         system updates the allocations and the availability data for the transferred items but does         not change the item costs. No batch is generated for a single-step transfer that records item movement from one         location to another within the same warehouse.  When a transfer performed between different warehouses is released, the system updates         allocations and availability data, updates cost statistics, and generates a GL batch of the         following transactions:  Inventory  account: Cr, COGS amount Inventory  account: Dr, COGS amount The Inventory account for each item is determined by the posting class of this item.

This data is updated by each         released inventory transfer that involves two warehouses. Two-Step Transfers If a company has multiple warehouses located at significant distances from one another,         moving stock items between warehouses may require some time. Thus, the costs of items in         transit are recorded temporarily to the In-Transit account.

For details, see  To Create a Two-Step Transfer. When this inventory transfer is released,             journal entries for the following GL accounts are created:  Inventory  account: Cr, COGS amount In-Transit  account: Dr, COGS amount The In-Transit account is specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences             (IN101000) form.

As a result, the  On Hand               Qty.  of the items in the source warehouse has been decreased. Transfer Receipt : Once the two-step transfer (the previous document) is released,           you must create a receipt for this transfer on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301000|IN301000]) Receipts           (IN301000) form by selecting the transfer by its reference number in the              Transfer Nbr.  box. When you do, all the information about the           transferred items will be added to the transfer receipt.  When this transfer receipt is             released, the system updates the item's availability data, updates cost statistics, and             generates a batch of the following GL transactions:  In-Transit  account: Cr, COGS amount Inventory  account: Dr, COGS amount You can view the reference number of this batch on the  Financial               Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304000|IN304000]) Transfers form: To view the             details of the batch, click the reference number of the batch in the  Batch               Nbr.  box. As the result of receipt being released, the  On Hand Qty.  of the         items in the destination warehouse has been increased, as you can view on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) form. Cost Updating The costs the transferred items will have in the destination warehouse depend on the         valuation methods assigned to the items. For items with the  Average  and  Standard           cost  valuation methods, the cost of an item in the destination warehouse will be the         same as at the cost of the item at the source warehouse. For an item with the  FIFO  or            Specific  valuation method, a transfer receipt creates a new cost layer with the         transferred quantity of the item and with the number and date of this transfer receipt. For         details, see the section below. An Example of Cost Updating for a FIFO Item  If a stock item with the  FIFO  valuation method was transferred from one warehouse to         another, a new cost layer for the transferred quantity is created. The history of         transactions in the table below illustrates what costs the transferred items will have in         the destination warehouse. Transaction Tran. Type Date Ref. Nbr. Qty. Warehouse Unit Cost Comment 1 Receipt Feb 01 RCP001 5 WHL1 300 A new cost layer was created. 2 Receipt Feb 01 RCP001 7 WHL2 450 A new cost layer was created. 3 Transfer Feb 08 TRAN001 -3 WHL1 300 A cost layer was updated; the quantity was decreased. 4 Transfer Receipt Feb 09 TRREC01 3 WHL2 300 A new cost layer (with 3 units) was created with the date Feb 9. ]]></column>

Physical inventory is an important process if your organization that sells items, because it gives you accurate numbers of goods in stock. Acumatica ERP provides you with various methods of physical inventory counts (such as full physical inventory and cycle counting). You set up physical inventory during configuration of the Inventory module in the system.{br}

In this topic, you will find basic information about configuring physical inventory in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Physical Inventory==
In Acumatica ERP, you can create as many types of physical inventory counts (called ''physical inventory types'') as you need by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form. The physical inventory type defines the way the system selects inventory items for counting, and the order of count lines in the physical inventory document. For each physical count, you have to prepare the physical inventory document; you can also print the count sheets and count tags. You do the following to configure a physical inventory type:
*Select the generation method—that is, the method that the system will use to generate the list of inventory items. You can select one of the following methods:
**''Full Physical Inventory''
** ''By Inventory''
** ''By Item Class''
** ''By ABC Code''
** ''By Movement Class''
** ''By Cycle''
*:For a detailed description of these generation methods, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Physical_Inventory_Types|Types of Physical Inventory].
*Decide whether you want to include items with zero book quantity in the physical inventory. This setting is available for all physical inventory types except ''Full Physical Inventory'' and ''By Inventory''.
*Decide whether you want to display the '''Book Qty.''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_10|Physical Inventory Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) form.
*Optional: Select a warehouse and warehouse location. If you use multiple warehouses or warehouse locations in the system, you can select a particular warehouse and location to perform the physical inventory. With the warehouse or location selected, the system will add to the list only items stored in this warehouse or location.
*Specify the assignment order. You define the order in which tag and line numbers are assigned to items on the count sheets prepared for counts of the selected type. These settings specify the sort order of count lines and, correspondingly, the sort order of the count tags that will be generated based on the physical inventory type. You can group items by one of the following entities:
**Inventory ID
**Inventory description
**Subitem (if you use subitems in the system)
**Lot/serial number (if you use lot or serial numbers in the system)
**Warehouse location ID (if you use multiple warehouse locations in the system)

In the physical inventory process, you can use count tags. Each count tag contains the information of the count line, including the book quantity and inventory ID of the set of units to be counted and recorded to the count tag. If you use tags, the system will assign a tag number to each line during the generation of the count sheet, with tag numbers in ascending order. To indicate that you want to use the tags, you select the '''Use Tags''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form ('''Physical Inventory Settings''' section) and specify the last tag number.((({S:Hint}We recommend that you specify a relatively large last tag number, such as 1000 or 10000, so that the tag number will be easily distinguishable at a glance from the book quantity that is also printed on the tag.
)))
After you have configured the physical inventory, you can start the counting process at any time, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Physical_Inventory_Counts|Physical Inventory Counts].

Most organizations conduct a full physical inventory count for each warehouse at least once a year. A full physical inventory greatly improves the accuracy of availability data, but it disrupts business processes and can be very costly.{br}

 Acumatica ERP provides you with the functionality to support physical counts for full inventory, as well as other alternatives. These alternatives includes cycle counting, whereby all items are assigned to specific cycles and separate physical counts are performed for each cycle&rsquo;s items at an appropriate frequency. Because counting by alternate methods can be conducted more quickly, these methods are less disruptive to daily operations.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the types of physical inventory available in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Types of Physical Inventory==
In Acumatica ERP, you can use basic or advanced types of physical inventory counts, which depend on your license configuration as follows:[anchor|#_c8ec57d2-5cd3-4389-afc4-2e51d96a7219]
*If the ''Advanced Physical Counts'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] CS100000) form, you can use only the full physical inventory. With this type, you count all inventory items in all warehouses. For details, see [[#_c93b596a-d3a8-407f-abb1-53c390e48871|Full Physical Inventory].
*If the ''Advanced Physical Counts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] CS100000) form, you can use the following advanced types of physical inventory counts:
**By item class: With this type, you count only stock items of the item classes you select. For more information, see: [[#_fb1f9130-8397-410d-b2ea-5cf54a163e7c|Count by Item Class].
**By specific stock stems: With this type, you count only particular stock items. For details, see [[#_41f48f72-6e83-4ee1-8530-edb1ed63006d|Count by Specific Stock Items].
**By cycle or by cycle count frequency: With this type, you count stock items depending on the specified counting frequency. For more information, see [[#_c3abacfb-eeb1-47ed-b66b-e7d8e6b40f37|Count by Cycle and by Cycle Count Frequency].
**By movement class or by associated count frequency: With this type, you count stock items depending on their turnover rates. For details, see [[#_ebde4ea9-921d-43ab-88e9-1b952f73c998|Count by Movement Class and by Associated Count Frequency]
**By ABC code and by code count frequency: With this type, you can count stock items depending on their stock values. For more information, see [[#_2726dde2-8370-48bc-b599-13ffe17f81d3|Count by ABC Code and by Code Count Frequency].

==Full Physical Inventory==
If you select the ''Full Physical Inventory'' generation method on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form, the resulting physical inventory document includes all stock items available in the specified warehouse, in all locations or only in the selected ones, with all combinations of subitem codes (if your implementation of Acumatica ERP uses subitems) and lot or serial numbers (if you use them in the system). For details about how to create a type for full physical inventory, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Create_Full_Count_PI_Type|To Create a PI Type for a Full Count].{br}

Counting all the items in the warehouse is a time-consuming procedure generally performed before a planned closing of financial period. All movements of inventory involved in counting should be stopped during counting, and no transactions are released during counting.[anchor|#_fb1f9130-8397-410d-b2ea-5cf54a163e7c]
==Count by Item Class==
Depending on how you have defined item classes, you may decide to perform counts by item class. For example, one item class may include your company&rsquo;s most valuable items, which you count more frequently.{br}

If you select the ''By Item Class'' method on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form, the '''Item Class Selection''' tab appears. On this tab, you can add one item class or multiple item classes for which the counting will be performed. If you add an item class that has child item classes, the physical inventory count is performed for the selected item class and all its child item classes as well.[anchor|#_41f48f72-6e83-4ee1-8530-edb1ed63006d]
==Count by Specific Stock Items==
By using the ''By Inventory'' generation method, you can create physical inventory types that generate count sheets with particular stock items. You select the appropriate method of selecting items on the '''Inventory Item Selection''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form, which appears when you select the ''By Inventory'' generation method. You can select one of the following item selection methods in the '''Select Method''' box:[anchor|#ul_lz2_1fg_dr]
*''Items Having Negative Book Qty.'': Acumatica ERP can allow a negative inventory balance for items of specific item classes. Negative quantities may be allowed for a warehouse or to a specific location in a warehouse if the aggregated inventory is positive. The physical count may show positive values. 
*:You can create a physical inventory type based on this selection method, and specify that items should be selected for counting only if they have a negative quantity at one location or multiple locations in the system. With this type, you can check the actual availability of items shown on the books with negative quantities.
*''Random Items'': To evaluate the accuracy of item availability data, your organization might find it helpful to occasionally count items selected at random. By using this option, you can also check the accuracy of the full physical inventory. 
*:When you select the ''Random Items (up to)'' selection method, you also specify the number of items for counting. The system generates a count sheet with a randomly selected list of items.
*''Last Count On Or Before'': You can create a physical inventory type for a particular warehouse or any warehouse that would generate a list of items that were counted a specified number of days ago or earlier. 
*:When you select the ''Last Count On or Before'' selection method, in the '''Last Count Before (Days) '''box that appears to the right of the '''Selection Method '''box, specify the number of days. Items counted the specified number of days ago or sooner are included in this list, regardless of the physical count type in which the item was involved earlier.
*''List of Items'': In some cases, you may want to perform physical inventory for only particular items. For example, you may want to count the most valuable items stored at a specific location every other day. 
*:To count only particular items, you specify the ''List Of Items'' selection method and add the required items to the list.
[anchor|#_c3abacfb-eeb1-47ed-b66b-e7d8e6b40f37]
==Count by Cycle and by Cycle Count Frequency==
You can configure physical counting to be performed with a regular time interval by using cycle counting. You select the ''By Cycle'' generation method on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form to create an inventory type by cycle. For details on configuring this type of physical counting, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Cycle_Counting_Configuration|Cycle Counting Configuration].{br}

The ''By Cycle'' generation method has the following variations:[anchor|#_4394881f-ef71-47d8-aa26-c722bbd1de8e]
*Including in the count only the items assigned to a particular cycle: For this variation, you specify the cycle in the '''Cycle ID''' box and clear the '''By Frequency''' check box on the '''PI Cycle Selection''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] form.
*Including the items of all cycles for which counting is due based on the frequency associated with their cycles: For this variation, you do not specify a cycle; instead, you select the '''By Frequency''' check box on the '''PI Cycle Selection''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] form.
[anchor|#_ebde4ea9-921d-43ab-88e9-1b952f73c998]
==Count by Movement Class and by Associated Count Frequency==
The more often a product is received or shipped, the less accurate its availability data may become. Thus, you may want to count items with higher turnover rates more frequently. To configure this type of physical inventory in Acumatica ERP, you define movement classes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_86_00|Movement Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208600|IN208600]) form and assign items to classes either on a permanent basis or by using their turnover rates during the specified turnover period. You then create a physical inventory type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form with the ''By Movement Class'' generation method.{br}

The ''By Movement Class'' generation method has two variations, depending on the settings you specify on the '''Movement Class Selection''' tab (which appears when you select this generation method): [anchor|#_12b1174d-6ed4-4dd6-b791-fdc6724e42f5]
*Including in a count only the items assigned to a particular movement class: For this variation, specify a movement class in the '''Movement Class ID''' box and clear the '''By Frequency''' check box.
*Including the items of all classes for which counting is due based on the frequency associated with the movement class: For this variation, select the '''By Frequency''' check box rather than specifying a movement class.

Once items are assigned to movement classes, you can organize counting by movement classes in the following way: [anchor|#_7fe6459e-f294-41e9-a6ba-51c0732eac8c]
*Perform an initial full physical inventory
*Conduct subsequent counts in one of these ways: 
**By creating a type for each movement class and performing counts of each type at the frequency defined for the movement class.
**By creating a type with the '''By Frequency''' check box selected for the ''By Movement Class'' generation method. Make sure that the count-per-year values are factors of the largest count-per-year value. A physical inventory document in such a case can include items of multiple movement classes for which count-per-year values are factors of the largest count-per-year value. Conduct counts at a frequency defined by the largest value of counts per year required for movement classes.
[anchor|#_2726dde2-8370-48bc-b599-13ffe17f81d3]
==Count by ABC Code and by Code Count Frequency==
If your company uses ABC codes to identify items critical to your business, select the ''By ABC Code'' generation method to have counts performed based on the frequencies required for items with different codes assigned. ABC codes, which you create by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_85_00|ABC Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208500|IN208500]) form, group items by their stock value in a specific warehouse in a specific period, based on the period-to-date balances of inventory accounts. ABC codes divide items into groups that require different management and controls; for example, ''A'' code items, because of their high impact on the business, should be counted more often than items with other codes assigned. {br}

The generation method for counting based on ABC codes has two variations, based on your specifications on the '''ABC Code Selection''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form, which appears when you select this generation method: [anchor|#_08b4a09f-8d94-4b61-b116-d5679727e163]
*Including in a count only the items assigned to a particular ABC code: For this variation, specify a code in the '''ABC Code''' box and leave the '''By Frequency''' check box clear.
*Including the items with any code for which counting is due based on the frequency associated with the ABC code: For this variation, select the '''By Frequency''' check box and do not specify an ABC code.

Once ABC codes are assigned to items, you can organize counting by ABC codes in the following way: [anchor|#_f589dfcd-587e-4e1b-b934-58d558814a99]
*Perform an initial full physical inventory.
*Conduct counts in one of these ways: 
**Create a type for each ABC code defined in the system (which has a specific frequency specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_85_00|ABC Codes] form). Conduct counts for items assigned to every code with the appropriate frequencies.
**Define one type for counts based on ABC codes with the '''By Frequency''' check box selected. Make sure that the count-per-year values for different codes are factors of the largest count-per-year value. Then when you&rsquo;re preparing the physical inventory document, only items that are due for counting by their code frequency will be included. A physical inventory document in this case can include items with different codes assigned for which count-per-year values are factors of the largest count-per-year value.

For details on configuration, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Set_up_PI_by_ABCcodes|To Create a Physical Inventory Type for an ABC Code].{br}

Counting by ABC codes usually works best for maintaining accurate inventory counts because in most businesses, a small number of items generally accounts for the largest value of stock, and with this method, you count the high-value items most frequently.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Types of Physical Inventory Most organizations conduct a full physical inventory count for each warehouse at least once         a year. A full physical inventory greatly improves the accuracy of availability data, but it         disrupts business processes and can be very costly.  Acumatica ERP provides you with the functionality to support physical counts for full inventory, as         well as other alternatives. These alternatives includes cycle counting, whereby all items         are assigned to specific cycles and separate physical counts are performed for each cycle's         items at an appropriate frequency. Because counting by alternate methods can be conducted         more quickly, these methods are less disruptive to daily operations. In this topic, you will read about the types of physical inventory available in  Acumatica ERP. Types of Physical Inventory In  Acumatica ERP, you can use basic or advanced types of physical inventory counts, which depend on your         license configuration as follows: If the  Advanced Physical Counts  feature is disabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features CS100000) form, you can use only the full physical             inventory. With this type, you count all inventory items in all warehouses. For details,             see  Full Physical Inventory Full Physical Inventory. If the  Advanced Physical Counts  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features CS100000) form, you can use the following advanced types of             physical inventory counts: By item class: With this type, you count only stock items of the item classes you                 select. For more information, see:  Count by Item Class Count by Item Class. By specific stock stems: With this type, you count only particular stock items.                 For details, see  Count by Specific Stock Items Count by Specific Stock Items. By cycle or by cycle count frequency: With this type, you count stock items                 depending on the specified counting frequency. For more information, see  Count by Cycle and by Cycle Count Frequency Count by Cycle and by Cycle Count Frequency. By movement class or by associated count frequency: With this type, you count                 stock items depending on their turnover rates. For details, see  Count by Movement Class and by Associated Count Frequency Count by Movement Class and by Associated Count FrequencyBy ABC code and by code count frequency: With this type, you can count stock items                 depending on their stock values. For more information, see  Count by ABC Code and by Code Count Frequency Count by ABC Code and by Code Count Frequency. Full Physical Inventory If you select the  Full Physical Inventory  generation method on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form, the resulting physical inventory document         includes all stock items available in the specified warehouse, in all locations or only in         the selected ones, with all combinations of subitem codes (if your implementation of  Acumatica ERP uses subitems) and lot or serial numbers (if you use them in the system). For details         about how to create a type for full physical inventory, see  To Create a PI Type for a Full Count. Counting all the items in the warehouse is a time-consuming procedure generally performed         before a planned closing of financial period. All movements of inventory involved in         counting should be stopped during counting, and no transactions are released during         counting. Count by Item Class Depending on how you have defined item classes, you may decide to perform counts by item         class. For example, one item class may include your company's most valuable items, which you         count more frequently. If you select the  By Item Class  method on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types         (IN208900) form, the  Item Class Selection  tab appears. On this tab,         you can add one item class or multiple item classes for which the counting will be         performed. If you add an item class that has child item classes, the physical inventory         count is performed for the selected item class and all its child item classes as well. Count by Specific Stock Items By using the  By Inventory  generation method, you can create physical inventory types         that generate count sheets with particular stock items. You select the appropriate method of         selecting items on the  Inventory Item Selection  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form, which appears when you select the  By           Inventory  generation method. You can select one of the following item selection         methods in the  Select Method  box: Items Having Negative Book Qty. :  Acumatica ERP can allow a negative inventory balance for items of specific item classes. Negative           quantities may be allowed for a warehouse or to a specific location in a warehouse if the           aggregated inventory is positive. The physical count may show positive values.  You can             create a physical inventory type based on this selection method, and specify that items             should be selected for counting only if they have a negative quantity at one location or             multiple locations in the system. With this type, you can check the actual availability             of items shown on the books with negative quantities. Random Items : To evaluate the accuracy of item availability data, your           organization might find it helpful to occasionally count items selected at random. By           using this option, you can also check the accuracy of the full physical inventory.  When             you select the  Random Items (up to)  selection method, you also specify the number             of items for counting. The system generates a count sheet with a randomly selected list             of items. Last Count On Or Before : You can create a physical inventory type for a           particular warehouse or any warehouse that would generate a list of items that were           counted a specified number of days ago or earlier.  When you select the  Last Count On               or Before  selection method, in the  Last Count Before (Days)              box that appears to the right of the  Selection Method              box, specify the number of days. Items counted the specified number of days             ago or sooner are included in this list, regardless of the physical count type in which             the item was involved earlier. List of Items : In some cases, you may want to perform physical inventory for only           particular items. For example, you may want to count the most valuable items stored at a           specific location every other day.  To count only particular items, you specify the                List Of Items  selection method and add the required items to the list. Count by Cycle and by Cycle Count Frequency You can configure physical counting to be performed with a regular time interval by using         cycle counting. You select the  By Cycle  generation method on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form to create an inventory type by cycle. For         details on configuring this type of physical counting, see  Cycle Counting Configuration. The  By Cycle  generation method has the following variations: Including in the count only the items assigned to a particular cycle: For this           variation, you specify the cycle in the  Cycle ID  box and clear the              By Frequency  check box on the  PI Cycle             Selection  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types form. Including the items of all cycles for which counting is due based on the frequency           associated with their cycles: For this variation, you do not specify a cycle; instead, you           select the  By Frequency  check box on the  PI Cycle             Selection  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types form. Count by Movement Class and by Associated Count Frequency The more often a product is received or shipped, the less accurate its availability data         may become. Thus, you may want to count items with higher turnover rates more frequently. To         configure this type of physical inventory in  Acumatica ERP, you define movement classes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208600|IN208600]) Movement Classes         (IN208600) form and assign items to classes either on a permanent basis or by using their         turnover rates during the specified turnover period. You then create a physical inventory         type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form with the  By Movement           Class  generation method. The  By Movement Class  generation method has two variations, depending on the         settings you specify on the  Movement Class Selection  tab (which         appears when you select this generation method):  Including in a count only the items assigned to a particular movement class: For this           variation, specify a movement class in the  Movement Class ID  box           and clear the  By Frequency  check box. Including the items of all classes for which counting is due based on the frequency           associated with the movement class: For this variation, select the  By             Frequency  check box rather than specifying a movement class. Once items are assigned to movement classes, you can organize counting by movement classes         in the following way:  Perform an initial full physical inventory Conduct subsequent counts in one of these ways:  By creating a type for each movement class and performing counts of each type at the               frequency defined for the movement class. By creating a type with the  By Frequency  check box selected               for the  By Movement Class  generation method. Make sure that the count-per-year               values are factors of the largest count-per-year value. A physical inventory document               in such a case can include items of multiple movement classes for which count-per-year               values are factors of the largest count-per-year value. Conduct counts at a frequency               defined by the largest value of counts per year required for movement classes. Count by ABC Code and by Code Count Frequency If your company uses ABC codes to identify items critical to your business, select the            By ABC Code  generation method to have counts performed based on the frequencies         required for items with different codes assigned. ABC codes, which you create by using the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN208500|IN208500]) ABC Codes (IN208500) form, group items by their stock         value in a specific warehouse in a specific period, based on the period-to-date balances of         inventory accounts. ABC codes divide items into groups that require different management and         controls; for example,  A  code items, because of their high impact on the business,         should be counted more often than items with other codes assigned.  The generation method for counting based on ABC codes has two variations, based on your         specifications on the  ABC Code Selection  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form, which appears when you select this generation         method:  Including in a count only the items assigned to a particular ABC code: For this           variation, specify a code in the  ABC Code  box and leave the              By Frequency  check box clear. Including the items with any code for which counting is due based on the frequency           associated with the ABC code: For this variation, select the  By             Frequency  check box and do not specify an ABC code. Once ABC codes are assigned to items, you can organize counting by ABC codes in the         following way:  Perform an initial full physical inventory. Conduct counts in one of these ways:  Create a type for each ABC code defined in the system (which has a specific               frequency specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208500|IN208500]) ABC Codes form). Conduct counts for               items assigned to every code with the appropriate frequencies. Define one type for counts based on ABC codes with the  By                 Frequency  check box selected. Make sure that the count-per-year values               for different codes are factors of the largest count-per-year value. Then when you're               preparing the physical inventory document, only items that are due for counting by               their code frequency will be included. A physical inventory document in this case can               include items with different codes assigned for which count-per-year values are               factors of the largest count-per-year value. For details on configuration, see  To Create a Physical Inventory Type for an ABC Code. Counting by ABC codes usually works best for maintaining accurate inventory counts because         in most businesses, a small number of items generally accounts for the largest value of         stock, and with this method, you count the high-value items most frequently.  ]]></column>

For more information about             search capabilities, see  Search in the Modern UI. To Create a PI Type for a Full Count Open the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form by searching                 for or navigating to it. On the form toolbar, click  Add New Record . In the  Type ID  box of the Summary area, type the unique                 identifier for the new physical inventory type. In the  Description  box, type a brief description indicating                 that this is the full count. In the  Generation Method  box, select  Full Physical                     Inventory . If you want to hide the  Book Qty.  column on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) Physical Inventory Count (IN305010) form, select the                      Hide Book Qty. on PI Count  check box. Optional: If full counts will be performed only in this warehouse, on the                      Warehouse/Location Selection  tab, specify the warehouse                 where the full count should be performed. This tab appears only if the                          Multiple Warehouses  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. On the  Assignment Order  tab, do the following: In the drop-down boxes, select entities for the assignment order to be used                         on the count sheets. Optional: In the  Blank Lines to Append  box, specify                         the number of blank lines to add to the count sheets. On the form toolbar, click  Save . ]]></column>

In inventory management, you can use ABC codes and movement classes to identify categories of stock that may require different management and controls. By using these categorization methods, you can rank inventory items by their cost and turnover, respectively. This information can be used to group items for planning physical inventory counts and for making strategic and tactical decisions.((({S:Hint}The functionality that supports ABC codes and movement classes for inventory ranking is available only if the ''Advanced Physical Counts'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.)
))){br}{TOC}
==ABC Codes==
Data gathered on various types of businesses shows that the 80-20 rule applies to most of them: 80% of the effect is generated by 20% of the cause. Similar logic generally applies to inventory: 
*A small number of items (which can be designated with the ''A'' code) typically accounts for the largest value of stock.
*A slightly larger number of items (''B'' code items) accounts for a smaller yet significant stock value.
*The remaining large number of items (''C'' code items) accounts for only a small part of stock value.
((({S:Hint}In Acumatica ERP, the ABC codes are specified in such a way that the total of percentages for all codes should be equal to 100%.
)))
Ranking items by stock values can be used as the basis for planning efficient physical inventories in which ''A'' items are counted more often than ''B'' items (which in turn are counted more often than ''C'' items). This reduces the total number of counts performed while maintaining more accurate inventory levels. {br}

You define the ABC codes to be used for inventory items (stock items) by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_85_00|ABC Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208500|IN208500]) form. For each code, you specify the percentage threshold and the frequency of physical counts per year. 
==Assignment of ABC Codes==
Initially, you can manually assign ABC codes to some items by using the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, and the items will have the same code assigned in every warehouse until the code assignment is updated for the first time. You should assign codes to only items for which codes will be fixed (that is, not updated over time) and skip initial assignment for other items. {br}

At the end of a financial period, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_60_00|Update ABC Code] ([~/?ScreenId=IN506000|IN506000]) form to mass-assign ABC codes to items based on their stock-on-hand values. For the selected warehouse and financial period, the system assigns pending ABC codes as follows: 
*The system arranges inventory items in decreasing order, based on their percentages of total stock.
*For each item, a subtotal is calculated as the item&rsquo;s percentage plus the previous subtotal (the sum of percentages of previous items).
*These subtotals are compared to the thresholds specified for codes as follows: Items for which the subtotals are less than the threshold for the ''A'' code are assigned the pending ''A'' code (including the item whose subtotal is equal to the ''A'' threshold if any). Items with subtotal percentages between the threshold for ''A'' and the sum of the thresholds for ''A'' and ''B'' codes will be assigned to the pending ''B'' code. Assignment continues in this fashion, and the subtotals for the ''C''-code items should be greater than the sum of ''A'' and ''B'' thresholds and less than the sum of the ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' thresholds.

You can view the list of the inventory items with their current and pending ABC codes, and update the ABC code assignments for all displayed items. {br}

The ABC analysis gives you an immediate view of items that are expensive to stock. By using this analysis, you can learn where your money is locked up and reduce the stock of expensive items. When planning physical inventories, you can perform counts for items with each code at the appropriate frequency for that code. {br}

Items with fixed codes are part of the assignment, but their codes do not change in accordance with the statistical data. ((({S:Hint}ABC code assignment should be performed only when a certain volume of statistical data is available. If the data is available for fewer items than a certain threshold number, no items will be assigned to the ''A'' code.
)))
==Movement Classes==
As with ABC codes, movement classes group items based on key inventory data—in this case, stock turnover rates. Items are grouped into a few classes, such as fast moving items, normal moving items, slow moving items, and dormant items. For each movement class, which is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_86_00|Movement Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208600|IN208600]) form, you specify the frequency of physical counts per year and the threshold value based on turnover to assign inventory items to this class. {br}

The number of turnover periods per year for all warehouses is specified ('''Turnover Periods per Year''') on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. Inventory turnover rate for an item for a period is calculated as {{Quantity Sold during a turnover period / Average Quantity on Hand}}. The {{Average Quantity on Hand}} is calculated as a sum of on-hand quantities at the end of each last 12 periods divided by the number of periods in the last financial year, including the analyzed period.
==Assignment of Movement Classes==
You can initially assign items to movement classes by using the '''Attributes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form; these items will have the same class in every warehouse until movement class assignments are updated for the first time. You might instead initially assign to the classes only items for which class assignment will be fixed and skip assignment for other items. {br}

You can update movement class assignments for a particular warehouse and a selected turnover period by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_61_00|Update Movement Class] ([~/?ScreenId=IN506100|IN506100]) form. The system assigns movement classes to items as follows: 
*For each warehouse, the system arranges inventory items in decreasing order by their average turnover rate in this warehouse ({{Quantity Sold during a turnover period/ Average Quantity}}). The {{Average Quantity on Hand}} is calculated as a sum of on-hand quantities at the end of each last 12 periods divided by the number of periods in the last financial year, including the analyzed period.
*For each item starting from the item with the highest turnover rate, the item&rsquo;s turnover rate is compared to the thresholds (maximum turnover rates) defined for each movement class. If the item&rsquo;s turnover rate is less than or equal to the lowest threshold, the item is assigned to the appropriate class. If the item&rsquo;s turnover rate is between two successive thresholds, that is, less than threshold of the class N and greater than or equal to the threshold for the class M, then the item is assigned to the class N. 

When planning physical inventories, you can organize counts by the frequencies specified for movement classes. Thus, you can perform counts for items with higher turnover rates more frequently. Items of each movement class will be counted at the frequency you&rsquo;ve specified for the movement class.

Inventory turnover rate                 for an item for a period is calculated as  Quantity Sold during a turnover                     period / Average Quantity on Hand .

The system assigns movement classes to items as follows:  For each warehouse, the system arranges inventory items in decreasing order by                     their average turnover rate in this warehouse ( Quantity Sold during a                         turnover period/ Average Quantity ). The  Average Quantity on                         Hand  is  calculated as a sum of on-hand quantities at the end of                     each last 12 periods divided by the number of periods in the last financial                     year, including the analyzed period. For each item starting from the item with the highest turnover rate, the item's                     turnover rate is compared to the thresholds (maximum turnover rates) defined for                     each movement class. If the item's turnover rate is less than or equal to the                     lowest threshold, the item is assigned to the appropriate class.

When planning physical inventories, you can organize counts by the frequencies                 specified for movement classes. Thus, you can perform counts for items with higher                 turnover rates more frequently.

Any retail business must periodically perform full inventory counts. To minimize the planned closings of the business that are required for full inventory counts, you can use a combination of full physical inventory counting and cycle counting. ((({S:Hint}The functionality that supports cycle counting is available only if the ''Advanced Physical Count'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
))){br}

For cycle counting, all items are assigned to specific cycles, and separate physical counts are performed for each cycle’s items at the appropriate frequency. Because cycle counts can be conducted more quickly, they are less disruptive to daily operations; they also can be tailored to business processes of your organization. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Planning_for_Physical_Inventory|Configuration of Physical Inventory].{br}

We recommend that you set up physical inventory counts by cycles during the initial configuration of the Inventory module. However, you can configure cycle counting later as well.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the configuration of physical inventory counting by cycle.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Cycle Counting==
The configuration of cycle counting includes the following stages:[anchor|#ol_kxc_mmf_zl]
#Creating physical inventory cycles.
#:You should decide how often you want to perform full counts and which items you want to count more frequently (and how often). Thus, items of all cycles will be counted during the full inventory count, which is performed least frequently, and some of the other counts will include items of more than one cycle.

Optionally, you can create a physical inventory type for each cycle (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_PI_Types_for_Cycles|To Create a Physical Inventory Type for Counts by Cycles]). 

After you have configured the cycle counting, you can perform the physical inventory counts in the following order:[anchor|#_f8b7acf0-3dea-4d01-a35a-e6cede12ee56]
#Conducting an initial full physical inventory.
#Conducting other counts with the frequency determined by the largest (among all cycles) number of counts per year and by using the physical inventory type that selects items by their count frequency. For each count, only items that are due for counting by their cycle frequency will be included. Some counts will include the only the items with the largest frequency, while other counts will be joint counts—for items from two or more cycles.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Cycle Counting Configuration Any retail business must periodically perform full inventory counts. To minimize the         planned closings of the business that are required for full inventory counts, you can use a         combination of full physical inventory counting and cycle counting.  The functionality           that supports cycle counting is available only if the  Advanced Physical Count            feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. For cycle counting, all items are assigned to specific cycles, and separate physical counts         are performed for each cycle’s items at the appropriate frequency. Because cycle counts can         be conducted more quickly, they are less disruptive to daily operations; they also can be         tailored to business processes of your organization. For more information, see  Configuration of Physical Inventory. We recommend that you set up physical inventory counts by cycles during the initial         configuration of the Inventory module. However, you can configure cycle counting later as         well. In this topic, you will read about the configuration of physical inventory counting by         cycle. Configuration of Cycle Counting The configuration of cycle counting includes the following stages: Creating physical inventory cycles. You should decide how often you want to perform             full counts and which items you want to count more frequently (and how often). Thus,             items of all cycles will be counted during the full inventory count, which is performed             least frequently, and some of the other counts will include items of more than one             cycle. You create physical inventory cycles (physical inventory cycles) by using             the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208700|IN208700]) Physical Inventory Cycles (IN208700) form. For the full count and for each             cycle, you specify how many times in a year the items should be counted (that is, the             count-per-year value). For details, see  To Create Physical Inventory Cycles. Assigning stock items to the appropriate cycles.  If you configure cycle counting             during the implementation stage, you can assign stock items to physical inventory cycles             when you import the stock items from your legacy system. Otherwise, you need to assign             each item to an appropriate cycle manually. For more information, see  To Assign a Stock Item to a Physical Inventory Cycle.

If your company uses ABC codes to identify items that are critical to your business, you can set up physical inventory counts based on the ABC codes assigned to stock items. Counting by ABC codes may be the best method for maintaining accurate inventory counts if in your business, a small number of items accounts for the largest value of stock; with this method, you count the high-value items most frequently.

If you plan to use counting by ABC codes, we recommend that you set up physical inventory counts by ABC codes during the initial configuration of the Inventory module. However, you can configure ABC counting later as well.{br}

In this topic, you will find information about configuration of physical inventory by ABC codes.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of PI Counts by ABC Codes==
The configuration of counting based on ABC codes includes the following stages:[anchor|#ol_kxc_mmf_zl]
#Creating ABC codes and specifying counting frequencies for the ABC codes. 
#:When you plan count frequencies, you should make sure that the count-per-year values for different codes are factors of the largest count-per-year value (that is, the largest value can be divided by the smaller ones with no remainder). For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_ABC_Code|To Create ABC Codes].
#Assigning stock items to the appropriate ABC codes. 
#:If you configure counting by ABC codes during the implementation stage, you can assign the initial ABC codes to items when you import the stock items from your legacy system. Otherwise, you assign the codes to items manually. Later, as the statistical data on sales is collected, you can update ABC codes for items automatically, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Assign_ABC_Codes_to_Stock_Items|To Assign an ABC Code to a Stock Item].
#Creating physical inventory types. 
#:You create a type for a full count (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Create_Full_Count_PI_Type|To Create a PI Type for a Full Count]) and a type for counting by frequency (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_PI_Type_for_Counts_by_ABC_Codes_Frequency|To Create a Physical Inventory Type for Counts by ABC Code and Frequency]). Then when you are preparing the physical inventory document, the system will include only the items that are due for counting based on their code frequency. Also, you can create PI types for particular codes (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Set_up_PI_by_ABCcodes|To Create a Physical Inventory Type for an ABC Code]). You should plan the convention for the identifiers of PI types and decide how to organize data on count sheets for each type of count.

After you have configured counting by ABC codes, you can perform physical inventory in the following order:[anchor|#_ddc69898-6e0b-4aba-adb9-c42fd62350ac]
#Performing an initial full physical inventory.
#Conducting counts based on ABC codes by frequency.
#Optional: Conducting counts by particular ABC codes.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Configuration of Physical Inventory Counts by ABC Codes If your company uses ABC codes to identify items that are critical to your business, you can     set up physical inventory counts based on the ABC codes assigned to stock items. Counting by ABC     codes may be the best method for maintaining accurate inventory counts if in your business, a     small number of items accounts for the largest value of stock; with this method, you count the     high-value items most frequently. For more information on using ABC codes in  Acumatica ERP,     see  Inventory Ranking Methods. The functionality that supports counts by ABC codes is available only if the  Advanced      Physical Counts  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)     form. If you plan to use counting by ABC codes, we recommend that you set up physical inventory         counts by ABC codes during the initial configuration of the Inventory module. However, you         can configure ABC counting later as well. In this topic, you will find information about configuration of physical inventory by ABC     codes. Configuration of PI Counts by ABC Codes The configuration of counting based on ABC codes includes the following stages: Creating ABC codes and specifying counting frequencies for the ABC codes.  When you plan       count frequencies, you should make sure that the count-per-year values for different codes are       factors of the largest count-per-year value (that is, the largest value can be divided by the       smaller ones with no remainder). For details, see  To Create ABC Codes. Assigning stock items to the appropriate ABC codes.  If you configure counting by ABC       codes during the implementation stage, you can assign the initial ABC codes to items when you       import the stock items from your legacy system. Otherwise, you assign the codes to items       manually. Later, as the statistical data on sales is collected, you can update ABC codes for       items automatically, as described in  To Assign an ABC Code to a Stock Item. Creating physical inventory types.  You create a type for a full count (see  To Create a PI Type for a Full Count) and a type for counting by frequency (see         To Create a Physical Inventory Type for Counts by ABC Code and Frequency). Then when you       are preparing the physical inventory document, the system will include only the items that are       due for counting based on their code frequency. Also, you can create PI types for particular       codes (see  To Create a Physical Inventory Type for an ABC Code). You should plan the convention       for the identifiers of PI types and decide how to organize data on count sheets for each type       of count. After you have configured counting by ABC codes, you can perform physical inventory in the     following order: Performing an initial full physical inventory. Conducting counts based on ABC codes by frequency. Optional: Conducting counts by particular ABC codes. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP, ''default prices'' are the sales prices of stock and non-stock items that can be maintained optionally—for instance, for the items whose prices do not vary depending on the quantity purchased, the season, special promotional periods, and other factors. The default prices are expressed in the base currency and specified per base unit.{br}{TOC}
==Assignment of Default Prices==
If the ''Inventory'' feature is disabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form functionality of stock items is unavailable in the system. Thus you can specify default prices for only non-stock items. You can manually enter the default price for each non-stock item specified in the base currency for a base unit. You enter this price for the item in the '''Default Price''' box on the''' Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.{br}

If the ''Inventory'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, which means that stock items-related functionality is available in the system, you can enter default prices for both stock items and non-stock items. To enter default prices for a stock item, you use the '''Default Price''' box on the''' Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. The default prices for stock items and non-stock items are specified in the base currency and for the base units.((({S:Hint}Default prices for stock items are always set on a per-inventory ID basis, whether or not subitems are used in your system.
)))
If you need to enter default prices for many items or all of the items, you can create appropriate import scenarios to do this more quickly. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Integration\IS__con_Simplified_Import_Scenarios|Simplified Scenarios for Data Import].{br}

The decimal precision for default prices is defined by the number specified in the '''Price / Cost Decimal Places''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form.
==Usage of Default Prices==
In Acumatica ERP, you can maintain multiple price lists by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) forms.  However, if your company sells specific items whose prices do not vary depending on the quantity purchased, the season, special promotional periods, and other factors, you can create item classes for these items and maintain only default prices for them.{br}

The system uses the default price of an item as the default sales price when you create a sales order (or an invoice if you don&rsquo;t use inventory and order management functionality), but only if there are no other prices (base price, customer-class price, or customer-specific price) available for the item. You can view the sales prices available for the item on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
==Update of Default Prices==
You can update the default prices for stock and non-stock items as often as you need to. When updating price lists by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form, you can specify the method of calculating the updated prices (based on such factors as the item markup percent or the percent of increase), and the new prices will be calculated automatically. However, when you update the default prices, you cannot directly specify how to calculate the new values—you can calculate these prices externally by using any method you consider appropriate; then you enter the resulting prices manually on a per-item basis or import all of them from a file by using an import scenario.
==Limitations of Default Prices==
If you decide to maintain default prices for items, be aware about the following limitations:[anchor|#ul_wlq_1ms_1q]
*The system does not keep the history of default prices. A default price has no start date and no expiration date; once specified, the default price is used for the item until a new default price is entered.
*You cannot define default prices as promotional prices that are in effect for a particular date range or as tiered prices.

In Acumatica ERP, you can track stock item costs over time in accordance with the valuation method assigned to each item. Item costs are tracked for base units, as the units in which items are stored at warehouses or moved between locations or warehouses. Depending on the valuation method you have selected for the stock item, the cost of its base unit is either computed by the system based on purchase receipts or estimated outside the system and entered manually by a user.{br}

For information about how costs are maintained for non-stock items, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Non-Stock_Item_Support|Non-Stock Items in the Inventory Module]. For information on allocation of purchase price variance amounts for items with different valuation methods, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\IN__con_PPV_Allocation|Allocation of Purchase Price Variance].{br}

In this topic, you will read about valuation methods and costs in inventory.{br}{TOC}
==Valuation Methods==
The system uses the item&rsquo;s valuation method to revalue its stock and to determine its unit cost for sales orders and inventory transactions.((({S:Hint}The decimal precision for prices and costs is defined by the number specified in the '''Price / Cost Decimal Places''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form.
)))
You specify the '''Valuation Method''' for the item on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. You can assign one of the following valuation methods: [anchor|#ul_trk_h22_rj]
*''FIFO'' (first in, first out)
*''Specific''
* ''Average''
* ''Standard Cost''

These methods are discussed in detail in the following sections.((({S:Hint}You can reassign an item&rsquo;s valuation method from ''FIFO'' to ''Average'', from ''Average'' to ''FIFO'', and from ''Standard Cost'' to ''Average'' and ''FIFO'' at any time.
))){br}{TOC}
==FIFO Valuation Method==
If the ''FIFO'' valuation method is assigned to a stock item, its unit costs are recorded in layers, each of which is identified by the receipt date, the quantity, and the purchase price (unit cost).{br}

Each new receipt creates a new cost layer with specific unit cost. You can view the cost of the last layer in the '''Last Cost''' read-only box on the '''Price/Cost information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. ((({S:Hint}By default, the item cost is zero until it has been automatically or manually assigned.
)))
When a certain quantity of the stock item is issued, the cost for the item is assigned starting with the earliest available cost layer. If the quantity to be issued is greater than the quantity in the earliest layer, the entire quantity from the earliest layer will be issued (with the associated unit cost) and the rest of the required quantity will be issued using the next earliest layer (with another unit cost).{br}

Consider assigning the ''FIFO'' issue method to items actually issued from the inventory. This will help your company avoid discarding obsolete items.{br}

Suppose that a stock item was purchased in the following way:
*Cost layer 1: May 10, 5 units at $8 each
*Cost layer 2: June 10, 5 units at $10 each

The total stock cost is (5 &#42; $8) + (5 &#42; $10) = $90.{br}

Then suppose that a sales order has been created with 8 items. All units from cost layer 1, and three units from cost layer 2 will be used to complete the transaction, with the extended cost equal to (5 &#42; $8) + (3 &#42; $10) = $70. For the next sales order, there will be no more items with the $8 unit cost.((({S:Hint}For each location in a warehouse that has the '''Cost Separately''' check box selected on the '''Location Table''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, separate cost layers will be created, based on purchase receipts made to the particular location. If certain quantities of the items should be issued from the location, the extended cost will be computed based on those location-specific cost layers.
)))
For each warehouse, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] form, you also can define which costs should be used for items returned to the warehouse (on returns) and for items found during inventory counts (on inventory receipts) by selecting one of the following options in the '''FIFO Default Returns Cost''' box:[anchor|#ul_vpt_vnr_cq]
*''Average'': To recalculate the item cost as an average cost of available items
*''Last'': To set the item&rsquo;s cost equal to the last cost

==Specific Valuation Method==
The ''Specific'' valuation method is used for serialized items (those with lot or serial numbers). With this method, the unit cost for each item is defined by the unit&rsquo;s purchase price. The unit cost assigned to the item on its receipt will remain the same until the item is issued, used as a component, or sold.{br}

With the ''Specific'' method, cost layers are based on the serial or lot numbers. New receipts specifying the same serial or lot number will update the cost of the layer. {br}

For example, suppose that a stock item was purchased as follows:
*May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023423 at $2.00 each
*May 21, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023523 at $2.10 each
*May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023623 at $1.90 each
*May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023723 at $2.20 each

The total stock cost is $820. When items with the serial numbers 11023666 and 11023444 are sold, the unit costs recorded to the COGS account are $1.90 and $2.00 respectively. 
==Average Valuation Method==
If the ''Average'' valuation method (also known as ''average moving cost'') is assigned to the stock item, the unit cost will be calculated as the average weighted cost of all items at the warehouses—that is, the total costs of all quantities of the inventory items at the warehouses divided by the total quantity. This valuation method is used for items that do not require tracking by lot or serial numbers or by expiration dates.{br}

The system updates the average cost every time a new receipt specifying a unit cost different from the current average cost is released. Once this receipt has been released, a batch of journal entries will be generated to adjust the costs of all available items. You can view the current average cost in the '''Average Cost''' read-only box on the '''Price/Cost information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.{br}

Suppose that a stock item was purchased as follows:
*Layer 1: 100 items at $2.00 each
*Layer 2: 100 items at $2.10 each
*Layer 3: 100 items at $1.90 each
*Layer 4: 100 items at $2.20 each

The total stock cost is $820, and the average cost is $2.05. If you sell 250 items, the unit cost is $2.05, and the extended cost recorded to the COGS account is $512.5 = $2.05 &#42; 250. {br}

For each warehouse, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, you also can define which cost should be used for items returned to the warehouse (on returns) and for items found during inventory counts (on inventory receipts) by selecting one of the following options in the '''Avg. Default Returns Cost''' box:[anchor|#ul_j2j_54r_cq]
*''Average'': To recalculate the item cost as an average cost of available items
*''Last'': To set the item&rsquo;s cost equal to the last cost

==Standard Cost Valuation Method==
Standard costs, which are estimated to include some of the indirect and direct costs allocated, for stock items are determined outside of Acumatica ERP by cost experts. For an inventory item with the ''Standard Cost'' valuation method assigned, the unit cost is entered directly by a user in the '''Pending Cost''' box on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.{br}

For items with the standard cost valuation method, standard costs can be maintained for each warehouse separately if the '''Override Standard Cost''' check box on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form is selected for the item stored at a particular warehouse.{br}

The item cost doesn&rsquo;t change when new receipts are released.{br}

Suppose that a stock item with a standard cost of $2.50 was purchased in the following way:
*Layer 1: 100 items at $2.00 each
*Layer 2: 100 items at $1.90 each
*Layer 3: 100 items at $2.30 each
*Layer 4: 100 items at $2.60 each

The total stock cost is $1000. Any differences between the standard cost and the unit cost on receipts multiplied by the quantity on the receipt are recorded to the standard cost variance account. In this case, $50, $60, $30, and –$10 respectively. On sales orders, the unit cost will appear as $2.50.{br}

Generally, standard costs are revised at the end of the financial year based on the financial results of the year, although standard costs can be updated as often as required.{br}

If you want to update standard costs for inventory items, you use the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form. New values for standard costs are entered as pending standard costs. The pending cost assigned to an inventory item that uses the standard cost valuation method becomes effective starting on the date specified in the '''Pending Date''' box on this tab.{br}

If you want to make similar changes to many or all inventory items, you use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_20_00|Update Standard Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) form to enter new values and compare current and pending costs side by side for all inventory items. If you are satisfied with the changes, you can update the current standard costs with the pending standard costs for all items or only selected ones by using the '''Process All''' or '''Process''' action on the form toolbar.{br}

If you want to change the settings of the standard cost for the item stored at a particular warehouse by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form, you make the required changes on this form and then update standard costs by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_20_00|Update Standard Costs] form.{br}

The system doesn&rsquo;t keep a history of the standard costs for the inventory items, displaying only the last cost and current cost values on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. The historical costs that were effective before the last cost are not stored in the database.
==Item Cost Split by Subitem Codes==
 Acumatica ERP supports subitem codes, which can provide more detailed classification of the products, in addition to the inventory ID. The use of subitems may affect product costing if the ''FIFO'' or ''Specific'' valuation methods are used.{br}

Subitem codes, like inventory IDs, consist of segments. Products with the same inventory ID and different subitem codes can be costed as one item, or the cost may be split among different values of one of the subitem segments. This is controlled by the '''Include in Cost''' option, which is specified for each segment of the ''INSUBITEM'' segmented key by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form:
*If the check box is selected for the subitem segment, a separate cost layer is created for each value of the segment.
*If the check box is cleared for the segment, all items with different values in this segment are handled as one item for costing purposes. For such a segment, one segment value should be marked as the ''aggregating value''. It does not have to represent any real feature of the product (such as size or color); it will be used in cost layers to designate all available values of the segment.
((({S:Warn}Including or excluding the segment from cost calculation and changing the aggregating value may result in losing cost layers, because the cost layer is created differently when one segment is included in cost calculation and no segment is included.
)))
Subitems can affect only cost, while price is always set at the inventory item level. For more information about subitem use, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Inventory_IDs_and_Subitem_Codes|Inventory Subitems].
==Unit Cost and Extended Cost On Issues==
For items with the ''Standard Cost'' or ''Average'' valuation methods, on inventory issues, unit costs (costs with respect to the base unit) are specified in the '''Unit Cost''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form.{br}

If an item has the ''FIFO'' or ''Specific'' valuation method assigned, costs of its units may be different, and the '''Unit Cost''' box on the form displays the unit cost for the first unit to be issued, in accordance with the inventory item&rsquo;s issue method. You can invoke the '''Allocations''' dialog box to view particular items to be issued or to select them by lot or serial numbers. The '''Extended Cost''' value on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_00|Issues] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) form will automatically appear as the sum of the unit costs of all listed items.

The decimal precision for prices and costs is defined by the number specified in 				the  Price / Cost Decimal Places  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) Companies (CS101500) form. You specify the  Valuation Method  for the item on the  General Settings  				tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. You can 				assign one of the following valuation methods:  FIFO  (first in, first out) Specific Average Standard Cost These methods are discussed in detail in the following sections. You can reassign an item's valuation method from  FIFO  to 					 Average , from  Average  to  FIFO , and from  Standard 					Cost  to  Average  and  FIFO  at any time. FIFO Valuation Method If the  FIFO  valuation method is assigned to a stock item, its unit costs are recorded 				in layers, each of which is identified by the receipt date, the quantity, and the 				purchase price (unit cost). Each new receipt creates a new cost layer with specific unit cost. You can view the 				cost of the last layer in the  Last Cost  read-only box on the  Price/Cost 					information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form.

Then suppose that a sales order has been created with 8 items. All units from cost layer 1, 				and three units from cost layer 2 will be used to complete the transaction, with the 				extended cost equal to (5 * $8) + (3 * $10) = $70. For the next sales order, there 				will be no more items with the $8 unit cost. For each location in a warehouse that has the 					 Cost 					Separately  check box selected on the  Location 					Table  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form, 				separate cost layers will be created, based on purchase receipts made to the 				particular location.

For each warehouse, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses form, you also can define which 				costs should be used for items returned to the warehouse (on returns) and for items 				found during inventory counts (on inventory receipts) by selecting one of the 				following options in the  FIFO Default Returns Cost  box: Average : To recalculate the item cost as an average cost of available items Last : To set the item's cost equal to the last cost Specific Valuation Method The  Specific  valuation method is used for serialized items (those with lot or serial 				numbers). With this method, the unit cost for each item is defined by the unit's 				purchase price. The unit cost assigned to the item on its receipt will remain the 				same until the item is issued, used as a component, or sold. With the  Specific  method, cost layers are based on the serial or lot numbers. New 				receipts specifying the same serial or lot number will update the cost of the layer.  For example, suppose that a stock item was purchased as follows: May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023423 at $2.00 each May 21, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023523 at $2.10 each May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023623 at $1.90 each May 19, 100 items starting with the serial number 11023723 at $2.20 each The total stock cost is $820. When items with the serial numbers 11023666 and 				11023444 are sold, the unit costs recorded to the COGS account are $1.90 and $2.00 				respectively.  Average Valuation Method If the  Average  valuation method (also known as  average moving cost ) is assigned 				to the stock item, the unit cost will be calculated as the average weighted cost of 				all items at the warehouses—that is, the total costs of all quantities of the 				inventory items at the warehouses divided by the total quantity. This valuation 				method is used for items that do not require tracking by lot or serial numbers or by 				expiration dates.

Suppose that a stock item was purchased as follows: Layer 1: 100 items at $2.00 each Layer 2: 100 items at $2.10 each Layer 3: 100 items at $1.90 each Layer 4: 100 items at $2.20 each The total stock cost is $820, and the average cost is $2.05. If you sell 250 items, 				the unit cost is $2.05, and the extended cost recorded to the COGS account is $512.5 				= $2.05 * 250.

For items with the standard cost valuation method, standard costs can be maintained 				for each warehouse separately if the  Override Standard Cost  check box on the 					 Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form is selected for the item 				stored at a particular warehouse. The item cost doesn't change when new receipts are released. Suppose that a stock item with a standard cost of $2.50 was purchased in the 				following way: Layer 1: 100 items at $2.00 each Layer 2: 100 items at $1.90 each Layer 3: 100 items at $2.30 each Layer 4: 100 items at $2.60 each The total stock cost is $1000. Any differences between the standard cost and the unit 				cost on receipts multiplied by the quantity on the receipt are recorded to the 				standard cost variance account. In this case, $50, $60, $30, and –$10 				respectively. On sales orders, the unit cost will appear as $2.50. Generally, standard costs are revised at the end of the financial year based on the 				financial results of the year, although standard costs can be updated as often as 				required. If you want to update standard costs for inventory items, you use the  Price/Cost 					Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form. New values for standard 				costs are entered as pending standard costs. The pending cost assigned to an 				inventory item that uses the standard cost valuation method becomes effective 				starting on the date specified in the  Pending Date  box on this tab. If you want to make similar changes to many or all inventory items, you use the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) Update Standard Costs (IN502000) form to enter new values and 				compare current and pending costs side by side for all inventory items. If you are 				satisfied with the changes, you can update the current standard costs with the 				pending standard costs for all items or only selected ones by using the  Process 					All  or  Process  action on the form toolbar. If you want to change the settings of the standard cost for the item stored at a 				particular warehouse by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details 				form, you make the required changes on this form and then update standard costs by 				using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) Update Standard Costs form. The system doesn't keep a history of the standard costs for the inventory items, 				displaying only the last cost and current cost values on the  Price/Cost 					Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. The historical 				costs that were effective before the last cost are not stored in the database. Item Cost Split by Subitem Codes  Acumatica ERP supports subitem codes, which can provide more detailed classification of the 				products, in addition to the inventory ID. The use of subitems may affect product 				costing if the  FIFO  or  Specific  valuation methods are used. Subitem codes, like inventory IDs, consist of segments. Products with the same inventory ID 				and different subitem codes can be costed as one item, or the cost may be split 				among different values of one of the subitem segments. This is controlled by the 					 Include in Cost  option, which is specified for each segment of the 					 INSUBITEM  segmented key by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys (CS202000) form: If the check box is selected for the subitem segment, a separate cost layer is 					created for each value of the segment. If the check box is cleared for the segment, all items with different values in this segment 					are handled as one item for costing purposes. For such a segment, one segment 					value should be marked as the  aggregating value . It does not have to 					represent any real feature of the product (such as size or color); it will be 					used in cost layers to designate all available values of the segment. Including or excluding the segment from cost calculation and changing the 				aggregating value may result in losing cost layers, because the cost layer is 				created differently when one segment is included in cost calculation and no segment 				is included. Subitems can affect only cost, while price is always set at the inventory item level. For more 				information about subitem use, see  Inventory Subitems. Unit Cost and Extended Cost On Issues For items with the  Standard Cost  or  Average  valuation methods, on inventory 				issues, unit costs (costs with respect to the base unit) are specified in the 					 Unit Cost  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues 				(IN302000) form. If an item has the  FIFO  or  Specific  valuation method assigned, costs of its 				units may be different, and the  Unit Cost  box on the form displays the unit 				cost for the first unit to be issued, in accordance with the inventory item's issue 				method. You can invoke the  Allocations  dialog box to view particular items to 				be issued or to select them by lot or serial numbers. The  Extended Cost  value 				on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000]) Issues (IN302000) form will automatically appear as 				the sum of the unit costs of all listed items.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN302000|IN302000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) ]]></column>

For effective inventory management, your company needs to know the value of the inventory at its warehouses. Acumatica ERP implements the perpetual system of maintaining the cost of inventory. With perpetual inventory system, your company can know the quantity of inventory on hand, its cost and the cost of goods sold at any moment of time.{br}{TOC}
==Multiple Valuation Methods==
Under the perpetual inventory system, the balance of the account Inventory (or multiple inventory accounts used for different warehouses or classes or groups of items) is updated with each sale or purchase transaction. Each time your company purchases stock items, the inventory account is debited for the cost of items; each time your company sells the items, the inventory account is credited for the cost of sold items.{br}

Under the perpetual inventory system, you can use inventory valuation (cost flow) methods to define how unit costs are determined for each inventory item on issues, thus allowing the system to maintain a correct, up-to-date inventory cost. You can use the following valuation methods:
*Standard cost
*Average
*First-in-first-out (FIFO)
*Specific

You assign valuation methods to stock items in the following ways:
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you can assign a valuation method to a class, which will be used for the items of the class.
*By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you can assign a valuation method to a particular item, if you want to override the valuation method of its item class.

The valuation methods are discussed in detail in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Item_Costs_and_Valuation_Methods|Item Costs and Valuation Methods]. 
==Negative Quantities==
In the Inventory module, a negative quantity of an inventory item of a specific item class is allowed at a location as long as the quantity on hand is positive. Appropriate warnings are issued on transactions that result in negative quantities. The '''Allow Negative Quantity''' check box is located in the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form.((({S:Warn}This check box can be applied to items with the standard cost, average cost, and FIFO valuation methods. You cannot apply this check box to items with lot or serial numbers assigned.
)))
Negative quantities on hand can result when an issue has been made before the receipt specifying arrival of the certain quantity of the inventory item is released. In this case, for over-issued quantity, a new layer is created. The cost assigned to the layer is the most recent historical cost of the item. When the inventory is actually received (on receipt in question release), the system compares the cost on the over-issue layer with the cost on the receipt, and generates a cost adjustment for the difference multiplied by the quantity on the layer (the quantity of over-issued units).
==Inventory Valuation and Revaluation==
You can review the cost of inventory on hand by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) and [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) reports.{br}

Generally, standard costs are revised at the end of the financial year based on the year’s financial results, although they can be updated more often. The pending standard costs and their effective dates are entered manually for each inventory item that uses this valuation method on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form.{br}

You can run the process of updating the standard costs with the pending standard costs for multiple inventory items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_20_00|Update Standard Costs] ([~/?ScreenId=IN502000|IN502000]) form. For items whose standard costs are being updated, revaluation of their cost is performed. The system generates a batch of transactions that increase or decrease the balance of the inventory accounts, depending on whether the pending costs are greater or less than the current costs and updates the Standard Cost Revaluation accounts defined by the item’s posting class.

The physical inventory process in a particular warehouse includes the following stages:[anchor|#ol_h15_c22_rj]
*Physical inventory preparation
*Counting of items
*Entry of counting data
*Adjustment generation

These stages are described in detail in the following sections, along with other key information about physical inventory counts.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_c47e0a7e-5101-46fd-a6bb-073831910ec7]
==Physical Inventory Preparation==((({S:Hint}Before you prepare any physical counts, make sure that all inventory documents have been released.
)))
You generate a physical inventory document by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) form. On this form, you select the appropriate physical inventory type for the count.{br}

For the physical inventory, you can select a particular warehouse and locations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] form only if the warehouse is not associated with the physical inventory type. Once you are done making selections on the selection tabs of this form, you click '''Generate PI''' on the form toolbar. The system generates a physical inventory document, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form, with the ''Counting in Progress'' status. The system assigns the document a reference number in accordance with the numbering sequence assigned to physical inventories on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.((({S:Hint}Starting at the moment when the physical inventory document is generated, no inventory transactions (issues, receipts, or transfers) are allowed that involve items included in the list, meaning that this inventory is in a frozen state. You can view the list of items involved in counting by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_00|Physical Inventory Locked Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409000|IN409000]) form.
)))
The generated physical inventory document contains the list of items for counting, arranged to the specifications on the '''Assignment Order''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] form. For each stock item included in the count, the document may have one line or multiple lines, depending on how many warehouse locations are used to store the item and whether the item has subitems or lot or serial numbers. In the simplest case—when such features as ''Inventory Subitems'', ''Lot or Serial Tracking'', and ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' are not enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form—a line identifies an item available in the warehouse with its book quantity.{br}

You can export the list of items for counting to an Excel file by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form. Alternatively, you can use the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_62_05_00|Physical Count Sheets] ([~/?ScreenId=IN620500|IN620500]) report to print item lists (count sheets) for distribution to all employees involved in counting. If you want to prevent employees from reusing the book quantity of items as the physical quantity instead of actually counting the items, you can hide the '''Book Qty.''' column from the printed count sheets by selecting the '''Hide Book Qty.''' check box in the report parameters.{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Preparation_for_Physical_Count|Preparation for Physical Count].[anchor|#_a9ad80d3-f72e-4341-9263-333405393080]
==Counting of Items==
Employees involved in physical inventory can start counting items after you distribute count sheets and count tags (if you use tags in physical counting) to the employees. The counting process includes the following steps:[anchor|#_7a30361d-93f3-4154-911c-7fd79e0895b3]
#Employees count the actual quantity of an item with the properties specified in the line (the specific inventory ID, lot or serial number, and warehouse location).
#Employees specify the quantity in the appropriate line of the count sheet.
#You indicate to the system that the counting process is finished by clicking '''Finish Counting''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form for the current count. On this form, you can see that the system has changed the status of the physical inventory document to ''Data Entering''.

After the counting process is finished,you can start entering counting data into the system.{br}

 Acumatica ERP provides you with ability to automate counting by using barcode scanners or mobile devices with barcode scanning support. For details, see [HelpRoot_OrderMgmt\SO__con_WMS|Automation of Warehouse Operations].[anchor|#_992b7a9a-11c3-45fd-b593-9cc681a1bbb5]
==Entry of Counting Data==
The process of entering counting data includes the following steps:[anchor|#_f8f8cca2-d0dc-4ee9-ae01-d8b2ac2c6303]
#Employees enter the counting data into the system manually or you import data from Excel spreadsheets, depending on the type of count sheets the employees used for counting.
#You review the data entered into the system after all lines have been entered.
#You complete the physical inventory process or cancel the process, depending on the entered data.
((({S:Hint}No movement of goods is allowed and no inventory transactions are released during the entry of the counting data if the '''Unfreeze Stock When Counting Is Finished''' check box is cleared for the physical inventory type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form. In this case, the inventory is frozen until data entry is completed.
)))
Manual data entry can be performed as follows. Multiple employees participating in counting can enter count data line by line simultaneously from different locations by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_10|Physical Inventory Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) form. Each line of the physical inventory document has its own status, and as count data is entered, the status of the line changes from ''Not Entered'' to ''Entered''. Once an employee enters the actual quantity in a line on this form, this data is committed to the database so the data can be visible to other users who are entering the data and to you if you are viewing the count data on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form. For details about the entry process, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Enter_Count_Data|To Enter the Count Data].{br}

Employees can simultaneously enter their count data from their computers by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_10|Physical Inventory Count] form. Once the user finishes the row on this form, the system commits the data to the database—all the quantities entered by multiple users will be summed up for each combination of inventory ID, subitem, warehouse location, and lot or serial number. This makes the most recently entered data immediately visible to all users who may be simultaneously using this form for data entry.{br}

If employees find items that are not listed in the count sheets, and the count sheets contain empty lines, these items must be entered into the system, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Enter_Count_Data_for_New_Items|To Enter the Count Data for New Items].{br}

To import the count data from an Excel spreadsheet, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form. For a physical count with the ''Data Entering'' status on this form, you can upload the file to the system, review the data on the form, and save the results to the database. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Import_Count_Data|To Import the Count Data From an Excel Spreadsheet].{br}

If all the lines of the document have the ''Entered'' status, you can complete the counting. You can cancel the physical inventory if you cannot complete it for some reason. If there is no valid data for some of the lines, you can set the count values to 0 or change the line status from ''Not Entered'' to ''Skipped'' and complete counting. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Enter_Count_Data|To Enter the Count Data].{br}

Once the entered data is verified, you can indicate to the system that the data entry phase is completed by clicking '''Complete PI''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review]. This changes the status of the physical inventory document to ''Completed''. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Complete_PI_Count|To Complete the Physical Inventory Count].{br}

Completing or canceling the physical inventory unfreezes the inventory items involved in the count.[anchor|#_987bcfbe-1bd7-4335-b7c7-07665f779acf]
==Adjustment Generation==
If the '''Release PI Adjustment Automatically''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form, when you complete the physical inventory, the system changes the status of the physical inventory document to ''Completed'' and generates the inventory adjustments to correct the on-hand quantities. An adjustment is generated for each item with a nonzero quantity variance, including the items with no associated transactions. The system uses the current costs of the items to calculate the cost variance. The reference numbers of these documents are displayed on the '''Adjustment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form; the status of these documents is ''Balanced''. You can review the generated adjustments on the '''Adjustments''' tab of this form.{br}

If the '''Release PI Adjustment Automatically''' check box is cleared, the system works as follows:[anchor|#ul_q5p_r2v_zgb]
*When you click '''Complete PI''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form, the physical inventory document has the ''In Review'' status and an adjustment is created with the ''Balanced'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form.
*In the adjustment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] form, you can edit the value of the '''Unit Cost''' column for particular items if the value of the '''Quantity''' column is positive for the item. When you manually change the unit cost and save the edited adjustment, the system changes the value of the '''Final Ext. Variance Cost''' column in the item line of the physical inventory document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form.
*You can delete an adjustment before the adjustment is released. After the adjustment is deleted, the status of the physical inventory document changes to ''Data Entering'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form. You can edit the physical inventory document and then create a new adjustment.
*When you successfully release an adjustment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] form, the system updates the values of the '''Final Ext. Variance Cost''' column in the item line of the physical inventory document and changes the status of the physical inventory document to ''Completed'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form.

==Cost Calculation After Counting==
The system specifies values in the '''Unit Cost''' and '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''' columns on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form when you click '''Finish Counting''' on the form toolbar. The system also updates these columns when users change the physical quantity while entering data.{br}

For lines with a positive variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the '''Unit Cost''' and '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''' columns based on the rules of the valuation methods specified for items as follows:[anchor|#ul_cf4_cz3_ygb]
*For the ''FIFO'' and ''Average'' valuation methods:
**The unit cost is calculated based on the values of the '''FIFO Default Returns Cost''' box (for the'' FIFO'' valuation method) or the '''Avg. Default Returns Cost''' box (for the ''Average'' valuation method) specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.
**If the average cost of the item is zero on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, the system uses the value of the '''Last Cost''' box on this form as the unit cost.
**If both the average cost and the last cost are zero on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form, the system uses the average cost on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form as the unit cost. If the average cost is zero, the system uses the last cost on the same tab as the unit cost.
*For the ''Specific'' valuation method:
**The system uses the cost layer that corresponds to the item as the unit cost. If multiple cost layers exist for the item, the system uses the last created cost layer as the unit cost.
**If no cost layers exist for an item with a specific lot or serial number, the system uses the last cost specified on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form as the unit cost.
*For the ''Standard'' valuation method:
**The system uses the current standard cost specified in the '''Standard Cost''' section of the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form as the unit cost.
**If the current standard cost is zero, the system uses the current standard cost on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form as the unit cost.

For lines with a negative variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the '''Unit Cost''' and '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''' columns based on the calculation rule of the adjustment; the system uses the data of the current cost layer for these calculations.{br}

The '''Update Actual Cost''' action recalculates the values of the '''Unit Cost''', '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''', and '''Total Variance Cost''' columns for lines with a negative variance quantity based on the calculation rule of the PI adjustment, and the system uses the data of the current cost layer. For lines with a positive variance quantity, this action recalculates the costs if the default costs were changed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Physical Inventory Counts The physical inventory process in a particular warehouse includes the following 				stages: Physical inventory preparation Counting of items Entry of counting data Adjustment generation These stages are described in detail in the following sections, along with other key 				information about physical inventory counts. Physical Inventory Preparation Before you prepare any physical counts, make sure that all inventory documents have been 				released. You generate a physical inventory document by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) Prepare Physical Count (IN504000) form. On this form, you select the appropriate 				physical inventory type for the count. For the physical inventory, you can select a particular warehouse and locations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) Prepare Physical Count form only if the warehouse is not 				associated with the physical inventory type. Once you are done making selections on 				the selection tabs of this form, you click  Generate PI  on the 				form toolbar. The system generates a physical inventory document, which you can view 				on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) form, with the  Counting in 					Progress  status. The system assigns the document a reference number in 				accordance with the numbering sequence assigned to physical inventories on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. Starting at the moment when the physical inventory document is generated, no inventory 				transactions (issues, receipts, or transfers) are allowed that involve items 				included in the list, meaning that this inventory is in a frozen state. You can view 				the list of items involved in counting by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN409000|IN409000]) Physical Inventory Locked Items 				(IN409000) form. The generated physical inventory document contains the list of items for counting, arranged to 				the specifications on the  Assignment Order  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types form. For each stock item included in the count, the 				document may have one line or multiple lines, depending on how many warehouse 				locations are used to store the item and whether the item has subitems or lot or 				serial numbers. In the simplest case—when such features as  Inventory 					Subitems ,  Lot or Serial Tracking , and  Multiple Warehouse 					Locations  are not enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) 				form—a line identifies an item available in the warehouse with its book 				quantity. You can export the list of items for counting to an Excel file by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form. Alternatively, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN620500|IN620500]) Physical Count Sheets (IN620500) report to print item lists 				(count sheets) for distribution to all employees involved in counting. If you want 				to prevent employees from reusing the book quantity of items as the physical 				quantity instead of actually counting the items, you can hide the  Book 					Qty.  column from the printed count sheets by selecting the 					 Hide Book Qty.  check box in the report parameters. For more information, see  Preparation for Physical Count. Counting of Items Employees involved in physical inventory can start counting items after you 				distribute count sheets and count tags (if you use tags in physical counting) to the 				employees. The counting process includes the following steps: Employees count the actual quantity of an item with the properties specified in 					the line (the specific inventory ID, lot or serial number, and warehouse 					location). Employees specify the quantity in the appropriate line of the count sheet. You indicate to the system that the counting process is finished by clicking 						 Finish Counting  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) form for the current count. On this form, you can see that the 					system has changed the status of the physical inventory document to  Data 						Entering . After the counting process is finished,you can start entering counting data into the 				system.  Acumatica ERP provides you with ability to automate counting by using barcode scanners or 				mobile devices with barcode scanning support. For details, see  Automation of Warehouse Operations. Entry of Counting Data The process of entering counting data includes the following steps: Employees enter the counting data into the system manually or you import data 					from Excel spreadsheets, depending on the type of count sheets the employees 					used for counting. You review the data entered into the system after all lines have been 					entered. You complete the physical inventory process or cancel the process, depending on 					the entered data. No movement of goods is allowed and no inventory transactions are released during the entry 				of the counting data if the  Unfreeze Stock When Counting Is 					Finished  check box is cleared for the physical inventory type on the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form. In this case, the inventory is 				frozen until data entry is completed. Manual data entry can be performed as follows. Multiple employees participating in counting 				can enter count data line by line simultaneously from different locations by using 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) Physical Inventory Count (IN305010) form. Each line of the 				physical inventory document has its own status, and as count data is entered, the 				status of the line changes from  Not Entered  to  Entered . Once an 				employee enters the actual quantity in a line on this form, this data is committed 				to the database so the data can be visible to other users who are entering the data 				and to you if you are viewing the count data on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review 				(IN305000) form. For details about the entry process, see  To Enter the Count Data. Employees can simultaneously enter their count data from their computers by using the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) Physical Inventory Count form. Once the user finishes the 				row on this form, the system commits the data to the database—all the quantities 				entered by multiple users will be summed up for each combination of inventory ID, 				subitem, warehouse location, and lot or serial number. This makes the most recently 				entered data immediately visible to all users who may be simultaneously using this 				form for data entry. If employees find items that are not listed in the count sheets, and the count sheets 				contain empty lines, these items must be entered into the system, as described in 					 To Enter the Count Data for New Items. To import the count data from an Excel spreadsheet, you can use the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form. For a physical count with the  Data 					Entering  status on this form, you can upload the file to the system, review 				the data on the form, and save the results to the database. For details, see  To Import the Count Data From an Excel Spreadsheet. If all the lines of the document have the  Entered  status, you can complete the 				counting. You can cancel the physical inventory if you cannot complete it for some 				reason. If there is no valid data for some of the lines, you can set the count 				values to 0 or change the line status from  Not Entered  to  Skipped  and 				complete counting. For details, see  To Enter the Count Data. Once the entered data is verified, you can indicate to the system that the data entry 				phase is completed by clicking  Complete PI  on the form 				toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review. This changes the 				status of the physical inventory document to  Completed . For details, see 					 To Complete the Physical Inventory Count. Completing or canceling the physical inventory unfreezes the inventory items involved 				in the count. Adjustment Generation If the  Release PI Adjustment Automatically  check box is 				selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form, when you complete 				the physical inventory, the system changes the status of the physical inventory 				document to  Completed  and generates the inventory adjustments to correct the 				on-hand quantities. An adjustment is generated for each item with a nonzero quantity 				variance, including the items with no associated transactions. The system uses the 				current costs of the items to calculate the cost variance. The reference numbers of 				these documents are displayed on the  Adjustment Info  tab of 				the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) form; the status of these documents 				is  Balanced . You can review the generated adjustments on the 					 Adjustments  tab of this form. If the  Release PI Adjustment Automatically  check box is 				cleared, the system works as follows: When you click  Complete PI  on the form toolbar of the 						  ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form, the physical inventory 					document has the  In Review  status and an adjustment is created with the 						 Balanced  status on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments 					(IN303000) form. In the adjustment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments form, you 					can edit the value of the  Unit Cost  column for particular 					items if the value of the  Quantity  column is positive for 					the item. When you manually change the unit cost and save the edited adjustment, 					the system changes the value of the  Final Ext. Variance 						Cost  column in the item line of the physical inventory document 					on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form. You can delete an adjustment before the adjustment is released. After the 					adjustment is deleted, the status of the physical inventory document changes to 						 Data Entering  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review 					form. You can edit the physical inventory document and then create a new 					adjustment. When you successfully release an adjustment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments form, the system updates the values 					of the  Final Ext. Variance Cost  column in the item line 					of the physical inventory document and changes the status of the physical 					inventory document to  Completed  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form. Cost Calculation After Counting The system specifies values in the  Unit Cost  and 					 Estimated Ext. Variance Cost  columns on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) form when you click 					 Finish Counting  on the form toolbar. The system also 				updates these columns when users change the physical quantity while entering 				data. For lines with a positive variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the 					 Unit Cost  and  Estimated Ext. Variance 					Cost  columns based on the rules of the valuation methods specified 				for items as follows: For the  FIFO  and  Average  valuation methods: The unit cost is calculated based on the values of the  FIFO 								Default Returns Cost  box (for the  FIFO  valuation 							method) or the  Avg. Default Returns Cost  box (for 							the  Average  valuation method) specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form. If the average cost of the item is zero on the  Price/Cost 								Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form, the system 							uses the value of the  Last Cost  box on this form 							as the unit cost. If both the average cost and the last cost are zero on the 								 Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form, the system uses the 							average cost on the  Price/Cost Info  tab of the 								  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form as the 							unit cost. If the average cost is zero, the system uses the last cost on 							the same tab as the unit cost. For the  Specific  valuation method: The system uses the cost layer that corresponds to the item as the unit 							cost. If multiple cost layers exist for the item, the system uses the 							last created cost layer as the unit cost. If no cost layers exist for an item with a specific lot or serial 							number, the system uses the last cost specified on the 								 Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form as the unit cost. For the  Standard  valuation method: The system uses the current standard cost specified in the 								 Standard Cost  section of the 								 Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form as the unit cost. If the current standard cost is zero, the system uses the current 							standard cost on the  Price/Cost Info  tab of the 								  ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form as the unit 							cost. For lines with a negative variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the 					 Unit Cost  and  Estimated Ext. Variance 					Cost  columns based on the calculation rule of the adjustment; the 				system uses the data of the current cost layer for these calculations. The  Update Actual Cost  action recalculates the values of the 					 Unit Cost ,  Estimated Ext. Variance 					Cost , and  Total Variance Cost  columns for 				lines with a negative variance quantity based on the calculation rule of the PI 				adjustment, and the system uses the data of the current cost layer. For lines with a 				positive variance quantity, this action recalculates the costs if the default costs 				were changed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010])  ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) ]]></column>

When you decide to perform a physical inventory, you must prepare for this process appropriately. As a result of the preparation, you generate a physical inventory document (count sheet) and distribute it among the employees who will perform the inventory.{br}

When you are preparing for a physical inventory, you perform the following steps:[anchor|#_be190556-e8ad-414b-a584-c0045ab704ca]
#At the warehouse, you organize the goods to prepare for counting, and you complete data entry related to normal warehouse activities that are not connected to the physical inventory. For details, see [[#_9c2ee11b-ce1f-4329-ace5-4f901a0212a4|Organizing Goods in a Warehouse and Preparing Book Quantities].
#You prepare accurate book quantities in the system, as described in [[#_9c2ee11b-ce1f-4329-ace5-4f901a0212a4|Organizing Goods in a Warehouse and Preparing Book Quantities].
#You create the count review document (count sheet) of the needed physical inventory type. For details, see [[#_42a06e26-3687-4016-898e-5ad02423a992|Creating and Distributing a Count Sheet].
#Optional: You add new lines to a prepared count sheet if you realize that the quantity of some stock items became nonzero after completing data entry related to normal warehouse activities. For more information, see [[#_051f8e6c-64e4-4a24-9f4c-d19658c93384|Adding New Lines to a Prepared Count Review Document].
#Optional: You prepare tag sheets. For details, [[#_4a03ef61-09ba-41f9-9a9a-5503a08660f7|Using Tags in Counting].

In this topic, you will find detailed information about the preparation process.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#_9c2ee11b-ce1f-4329-ace5-4f901a0212a4]
==Organizing Goods in a Warehouse and Preparing Book Quantities==
When you prepare for a physical inventory in your warehouse, you do the following:[anchor|#_4834bd46-c57c-44ea-9faf-b1e82e003ef8]
*You oversee the employees in organizing the goods at the warehouse to be able to count accurate physical quantities that match the book quantities. All goods should be placed in appropriate locations.
*You enter and release all inventory transactions that have been physically performed at the warehouse and have already affected the physical quantity.
*You process or delete any unreleased documents in the system, which you can find by clicking '''Unreleased Documents''' on the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_90_00|Close Financial Periods] ([~/?ScreenId=IN509000|IN509000]) form after you select financial periods.
{br}

The system produces the book quantity for physical counts as follows:{{{{(Book Qty) = (Qty on Hand) – (Qty on SO Shipped)
}}}}
The formula elements mean the following:{br}

{{Book Qty}}: The physical count book quantity{br}

{{Qty on Hand}}: The quantity of items on hand
{{Qty on SO Shipped}}: The quantity of items on sales orders that have been shipped
You have to exclude some items from the physical count because they are not reflected in the book quantity that is printed in the count review document (and used for comparison with the physical quantity). For example, you can place those items in a certain location in the warehouse, label the location to be certain the items will not be counted inadvertently, and skip the counting of this location. You have to make sure those items won&rsquo;t be mistakenly counted; otherwise, there could be an incorrect difference between the book quantity and physical quantity in the count review document.{br}

You have to exclude the following items from the physical count:[anchor|#ul_qjg_zyy_zs]
*Items that have been received to the warehouse if the receipts cannot be released in the system at the moment
*Items on unreleased inventory issues and not-yet-issued shipments if these items haven&rsquo;t been removed from the warehouse yet
[anchor|#_42a06e26-3687-4016-898e-5ad02423a992]
==Creating and Distributing a Count Sheet==
For every physical count that is performed at the warehouse, you have to create the count review document that is used for processing the count result. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) form, you can review the count lines that will be included in the count review document and initiate the process of creating the document. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__How_Prepare_PI_Count|To Prepare a Physical Inventory Count].{br}

After you select the physical count type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] form, a preview of the count lines with the tag numbers (if you use tags) is displayed that will be generated for the physical count iteration. Before you start the counting process, you can review the count lines to make sure the needed items are selected for counting and the order of count lines is as expected.{br}

After you have verified the count lines, on the form toolbar, you click '''Generate PI''' to prepare the count review document and start the counting process in the system. Starting at this moment, transactional activities should be frozen at the warehouse and the processing of inventory transactions must be paused in the system until the physical count is complete.{br}

When you click '''Generate PI''', the system performs the following actions:[anchor|#ul_hdq_tsj_xs]
*Generates the count review document that consists of the count lines, which should be populated with physical quantities. The system opens the count review document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form with the ''Counting in Progress'' status.
*:((({S:Hint}You can create the count review document directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form by clicking '''Add New Record''' on the form toolbar without first previewing the count on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] form. Regardless of how you generated the count review document, if you notice that it is wrong, you can click '''Cancel PI''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form, make the necessary changes, and create the count review document again.
)))
*Generates the count sheets, which can be printed by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_62_05_00|Physical Count Sheets] ([~/?ScreenId=IN620500|IN620500]) report, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Print_Count_Sheets|To Print Count Sheets].
*:Alternatively, you can export the count review document to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Export_Count_Sheet_to_Excel|To Export a Count Sheet to an Excel Spreadsheet]) if your organization uses non-paper processesfor counting. 
*Generates the count tags, which can be printed by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_62_10_00|Physical Count Tags] ([~/?ScreenId=IN621000|IN621000]) report. The tags will be generated if the '''Use Tags''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form at the moment. For details about how to print tag sheets, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Print_Tags|To Print Tags].
*Freezes the release of inventory transactions for the warehouse being counted. Under the ''Full Physical Inventory'' method, the system doesn&rsquo;t allow the release of any inventory transactions for the warehouse. For other physical count methods, the system doesn&rsquo;t release inventory transactions if they include items that are currently being counted at the warehouse. The system continues to freeze inventory transactions while the count review document has the ''Counting in Progress'' status.

In a count sheet, the items are arranged according to the settings on the '''Assignment Order''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form. For each inventory item included in the count, the document may have one line or multiple lines, depending on how many locations are used to store the item and whether the item has subitems or lot or serial numbers. For items with serial numbers assigned, a separate line is generated for each serial number.{br}

If the '''Use Tags''' option is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] form, the count sheet includes tag numbers for each line generated.[anchor|#_051f8e6c-64e4-4a24-9f4c-d19658c93384]
==Adding New Lines to a Prepared Count Review Document==
When the count review document is prepared, the system adds to the count review document (count sheet) only those inventory items that have a nonzero booked quantity. Thus, if you have prepared the count sheet and then the quantity of some inventory items that are not in the sheet has changed from zero to a nonzero quantity (due to items being found or received), you may need to add new count lines to the count sheet. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form, you can add a new line to a prepared count sheet as long as you adhere to the following rules:[anchor|#ul_egs_tnw_kbb]
*The location and warehouse that you specify in this line must match the location and warehouse selection criteria of the count sheet to which you are adding a line.
*You cannot add a line if the specified combination of inventory ID, location, and warehouse is already included in this physical inventory count.
*You cannot add a line if the specified combination of inventory ID, location, and warehouse is included in any other physical inventory count that currently is in progress.
*The item that you specify in this line must correspond to criteria of the physical inventory type which this physical inventory count is prepared. For example, if you count physical inventory by ABC code, the item should be assigned the ABC code selected in the settings of the physical inventory type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form. (This restriction applies to all physical inventory types except for those that have the ''Full Physical Inventory'' generation method.)

After you have added any new lines and saved your changes, no inventory transactions (issues, receipts, or transfers) are allowed for the added inventory items in the specified location and warehouse.[anchor|#_4a03ef61-09ba-41f9-9a9a-5503a08660f7]
==Using Tags in Counting==
Tags may or may not be used in the counting process, depending on your organization&rsquo;s policies for physical inventory counts. A tag count is useful for a full-scale end-of-year physical inventory.{br}

You can use tags in counts if the '''Use Tags''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form. With this check box selected, the system assigns a tag number to each line of the count sheets when you prepare the physical inventory count. Depending on the features enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, each tag can contain the following information:[anchor|#ul_jvj_qst_fs]
*Tag number
*Inventory ID
*Subitem (if the ''Inventory Subitems'' feature is enabled) 
*Lot or serial number (if the ''Lot and Serial Tracking'' feature is enabled) 
*Warehouse location (if the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is enabled)
*The book quantity of the item with these properties
{br}

You can print tags by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_62_10_00|Physical Count Tags] ([~/?ScreenId=IN621000|IN621000]) report, as described in [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Print_Tags|To Print Tags]. The tags can be distributed (in accordance with the count sheets) among employees who are participating in the count. Tags can be used for recording the results of the actual counting and for entering the count results when the counting stage is completed.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Preparation for Physical Count When you decide to perform a physical inventory, you must prepare for this process     appropriately. As a result of the preparation, you generate a physical inventory document (count     sheet) and distribute it among the employees who will perform the inventory. When you are preparing for a physical inventory, you perform the following steps: At the warehouse, you organize the goods to prepare for counting, and you complete data      entry related to normal warehouse activities that are not connected to the physical inventory.      For details, see  Organizing Goods in a Warehouse and Preparing Book Quantities Organizing Goods in a Warehouse and Preparing Book Quantities. You prepare accurate book quantities in the system, as described in  Organizing Goods in a Warehouse and Preparing Book Quantities Organizing Goods in a Warehouse and Preparing Book Quantities. You create the count review document (count sheet) of the needed physical inventory type.      For details, see  Creating and Distributing a Count Sheet Creating and Distributing a Count Sheet. Optional: You add new lines to a prepared count sheet if you realize that the quantity of      some stock items became nonzero after completing data entry related to normal warehouse      activities. For more information, see  Adding New Lines to a Prepared Count Review Document Adding New Lines to a Prepared Count Review Document. Optional: You prepare tag sheets. For details,  Using Tags in Counting Using Tags in Counting. In this topic, you will find detailed information about the preparation process. Organizing Goods in a Warehouse and Preparing Book Quantities When you prepare for a physical inventory in your warehouse, you do the following: You oversee the employees in organizing the goods at the warehouse to be able to count       accurate physical quantities that match the book quantities. All goods should be placed in       appropriate locations. You enter and release all inventory transactions that have been physically performed at the       warehouse and have already affected the physical quantity. You process or delete any unreleased documents in the system, which you can find by       clicking  Unreleased Documents  on the toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN509000|IN509000]) Close Financial Periods (IN509000) form after you select financial periods. The system produces the book quantity for physical counts as follows: (Book Qty) = (Qty on Hand) – (Qty on SO Shipped) The formula elements mean the following: Book Qty : The physical count book quantity Qty on Hand : The quantity of items on hand Qty on SO Shipped : The quantity of items on sales orders that have been     shipped You have to exclude some items from the physical count because they are not reflected in the     book quantity that is printed in the count review document (and used for comparison with the     physical quantity). For example, you can place those items in a certain location in the     warehouse, label the location to be certain the items will not be counted inadvertently, and     skip the counting of this location. You have to make sure those items won't be mistakenly     counted; otherwise, there could be an incorrect difference between the book quantity and     physical quantity in the count review document. You have to exclude the following items from the physical count: Items that have been received to the warehouse if the receipts cannot be released in the      system at the moment Items on unreleased inventory issues and not-yet-issued shipments if these items haven't      been removed from the warehouse yet Creating and Distributing a Count Sheet For every physical count that is performed at the warehouse, you have to create the count     review document that is used for processing the count result. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) Prepare Physical Count (IN504000) form, you can review the count lines that will be included     in the count review document and initiate the process of creating the document. For details, see       To Prepare a Physical Inventory Count. After you select the physical count type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) Prepare Physical Count form, a     preview of the count lines with the tag numbers (if you use tags) is displayed that will be     generated for the physical count iteration. Before you start the counting process, you can     review the count lines to make sure the needed items are selected for counting and the order of     count lines is as expected. After you have verified the count lines, on the form toolbar, you click  Generate      PI  to prepare the count review document and start the counting process in the     system. Starting at this moment, transactional activities should be frozen at the warehouse and     the processing of inventory transactions must be paused in the system until the physical count     is complete. When you click  Generate PI , the system performs the following     actions: Generates the count review document that consists of the count lines, which should be      populated with physical quantities. The system opens the count review document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) form with the  Counting in Progress        status. You can create the count review document directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form by clicking  Add New Record  on the form       toolbar without first previewing the count on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) Prepare Physical Count form.         Regardless of how you generated the count review document, if you notice that it is wrong,        you can click  Cancel PI  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form,        make the necessary changes, and create the count review document again. Generates the count sheets, which can be printed by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN620500|IN620500]) Physical Count Sheets (IN620500) report, as described in  To Print Count Sheets. Alternatively, you can export the count review document to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet       (see  To Export a Count Sheet to an Excel Spreadsheet) if your organization uses       non-paper processesfor counting.  Generates the count tags, which can be printed by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN621000|IN621000]) Physical Count Tags      (IN621000) report. The tags will be generated if the  Use Tags  check box      is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences form at the moment. For details about how to      print tag sheets, see  To Print Tags. Freezes the release of inventory transactions for the warehouse being counted. Under the        Full Physical Inventory  method, the system doesn't allow the release of any inventory      transactions for the warehouse. For other physical count methods, the system doesn't release      inventory transactions if they include items that are currently being counted at the warehouse.      The system continues to freeze inventory transactions while the count review document has the        Counting in Progress  status. In a count sheet, the items are arranged according to the settings on the       Assignment Order  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900)     form. For each inventory item included in the count, the document may have one line or multiple     lines, depending on how many locations are used to store the item and whether the item has     subitems or lot or serial numbers. For items with serial numbers assigned, a separate line is     generated for each serial number. If the  Use Tags  option is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences form, the count sheet includes tag numbers for each line generated. Adding New Lines to a Prepared Count Review Document When the count review document is prepared, the system adds to the count review document     (count sheet) only those inventory items that have a nonzero booked quantity. Thus, if you have     prepared the count sheet and then the quantity of some inventory items that are not in the sheet     has changed from zero to a nonzero quantity (due to items being found or received), you may need     to add new count lines to the count sheet. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000)     form, you can add a new line to a prepared count sheet as long as you adhere to the following     rules: The location and warehouse that you specify in this line must match the location and      warehouse selection criteria of the count sheet to which you are adding a line. You cannot add a line if the specified combination of inventory ID, location, and warehouse      is already included in this physical inventory count. You cannot add a line if the specified combination of inventory ID, location, and warehouse      is included in any other physical inventory count that currently is in progress. The item that you specify in this line must correspond to criteria of the physical inventory      type which this physical inventory count is prepared. For example, if you count physical      inventory by ABC code, the item should be assigned the ABC code selected in the settings of the      physical inventory type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form. (This      restriction applies to all physical inventory types except for those that have the  Full       Physical Inventory  generation method.) After you have added any new lines and saved your changes, no inventory transactions (issues,     receipts, or transfers) are allowed for the added inventory items in the specified location and     warehouse. Using Tags in Counting Tags may or may not be used in the counting process, depending on your organization's policies     for physical inventory counts. A tag count is useful for a full-scale end-of-year physical     inventory. You can use tags in counts if the  Use Tags  check box is selected on the        ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form. With this check box selected, the system     assigns a tag number to each line of the count sheets when you prepare the physical inventory     count. Depending on the features enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS101000) form,     each tag can contain the following information: Tag number Inventory ID Subitem (if the  Inventory Subitems  feature is enabled)  Lot or serial number (if the  Lot and Serial Tracking  feature is enabled)  Warehouse location (if the  Multiple Warehouse Locations  feature is enabled) The book quantity of the item with these properties You can print tags by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN621000|IN621000]) Physical Count Tags (IN621000) report, as     described in  To Print Tags. The tags can be distributed (in accordance     with the count sheets) among employees who are participating in the count. Tags can be used for     recording the results of the actual counting and for entering the count results when the     counting stage is completed. ]]></column>

If your organization prepares financial reports on a regular basis, accountants should close financial periods in all modules that your organization uses in Acumatica ERP. Before the reports can be prepared for a financial period, the accountants have to verify the account balances, process all necessary transactions for the period, and then close the financial period for further transaction processing.{br}

In this topic, you will read about the process of closing financial periods in Inventory.
==Closing Financial Periods in Inventory==
Closing a financial period in a module is a technical procedure that prevents the posting of new transactions from this module to the closed period, which is undesirable or might be even forbidden after all figures have been verified and disclosed in the reports.{br}

The closed periods cannot be selected in the '''Post Period''' box on inventory transaction data entry forms. However, a closed period can be typed manually in a transaction and the inventory transaction can still be processed to the period if the '''Restrict Access to Closed Periods''' check box is cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_20_00|General Ledger Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=GL102000|GL102000]) form. The '''Restrict Access to Closed Periods''' setting applies to the transactions that are produced by all modules that post transactions to the General Ledger module. Only users assigned to the ''Financial Supervisor'' role on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_05|User Roles] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201005|SM201005]) form can post transactions to closed periods; this is the case even when the '''Restrict Access to Closed Periods''' check box is selected.{br}

Closing a financial period in the Inventory module includes the following procedures:[anchor|#ul_wvv_tg4_dt]
*Inventory clerks count the physical inventory, and the warehouse manager makes the necessary inventory adjustments to make the book quantities of items equal to the physical quantities of items in the warehouse. For details on physical inventory counting, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Physical_Inventory_Counts|Physical Inventory Counts].
*The warehouse manager verifies and processes the necessary inventory transactions for the period. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Review_Unprocessed_Inventory_Transactions|To Review Unprocessed Inventory Transactions].
*The accountant reconciles the inventory account balance in the Inventory and General Ledger modules for the period. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Reconciliation_IN_Account_GL_Account|Reconciliation of the Cost of Inventory with the Account Balance].
*The accountant closes the financial period in the Inventory module. During the process of closing the period, the system verifies that there are no unprocessed inventory transactions entered for these periods, and marks the periods as closed in the Inventory module. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Close_Financial_Period|To Close Financial Periods in Inventory].

After the financial period is closed in all modules, the accountant can prepare the financial reports.

You can reconcile the inventory account balance by comparing the account balance calculated by inventory transactions with the account balance calculated by General Ledger transactions. If you discover a mismatch, each transaction has to be carefully reviewed in the Inventory and General Ledger modules, and corrective actions have to be made to eliminate the mismatch. Reconciliation is a recommended practice before period closing to verify the account balance and the transactions in the inventory account.{br}

In this topic, you will find recommendations for performing reconciliation of the inventory account balance with the General Ledger account balance in Acumatica ERP and the list of forms and report you can use for reconciliation. For simplicity, the topic describes the reconciliation process for only one inventory account. If you have multiple accounts, you can repeat the procedure for each inventory account.{br}{TOC}
==Reconciliation Process in Inventory==
Before starting reconciliation, you must you must decide which periods you want to close. In Acumatica ERP, you reconcile the inventory account balance for the ''last activity period'' (that is, the period when the last transaction was performed) and the ''historical periods'' (that is, the periods that precede the last activity period) separately. For the last activity period, the inventory account balance equals the cost of the inventory on hand.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you do the following to reconcile the balance of an inventory account in the Inventory and General Ledger modules:[anchor|#_6fc9de40-181b-461f-b2bd-db80a168f6d5]
#You reconcile the balance of the inventory account for the historical periods, as described in [[#_7385631f-858e-4029-95dd-796b543341aa|Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for Historical Periods].
#You reconcile the balance of the inventory account for the last activity period, as described in [[#_f0d77834-bff7-443d-9403-2bafe45fe193|Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for the Last Activity Period].
#If the balances of the inventory and General Ledger accounts disagree, you investigate the reasons. For details, see [[#section_ky1_rmb_2t|Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances].

For the list of Acumatica ERP forms and reports you can use in the reconciliation process, see [[#_eb01d874-4c04-4665-88ba-0ae3880b102b|Reports and Forms Used for Reconciliation in the Inventory module].[anchor|#_7385631f-858e-4029-95dd-796b543341aa]
==Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for Historical Periods==
You reconcile the balance of an inventory account for a historical period as follows:[anchor|#_e7919e71-f68d-4125-b905-19981ec8e8b6]
#You find the ending balance of the account in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) report as follows:
##You run the report with the following parameters:
##*'''Format''': ''Summary''
##* '''Start Period''': The historical period
##*'''End Period''': The historical period
##:((({S:Hint}If you want to review the account balance for multiple historical periods, in the '''Start Period''' box, you select the earliest period, and in the '''End Period''' box, you select the latest period.
)))
##In the '''Account/Subaccount Ending Balance''' line of the report, you find the ending balance of the account, which you reconcile, and record the balance.
#Optional: You review the inventory transactions and the ending balance of the inventory account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) form as follows:
##In the Summary area of the form, you do the following:
##*In the '''Inventory Account''' box, you select the inventory account for which you want to review transactions.
##*In the '''Period''' box, you select the historical period.
##*You select the '''By Financial Period''' check box to filter the transactions by post period.
##In the '''Ending Balance''' column of the last table row, you find the ending balance for the inventory account and compare it with the balance found in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] report. The balances should be the same.
#You find the ending balance of the inventory account in the General Ledger by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\GL_63_20_00|Trial Balance Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) report as follows:
##You run the report with the following parameters:
##*'''Ledger ID''': Select the ledger with the ''Actual'' type.
##*'''Financial Period''': Select the same historical period, for which you retrieved data from the Inventory module.
##In the '''Ending Balance''' column for the inventory account, you find the ending balance.
#You compare the ending balance in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] report with the balance in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\GL_63_20_00|Trial Balance Summary] report. You can receive one of the following results:
#*The balances agree: This means that the inventory account balance is reconciled for the selected period. You can start reconciling the same account for another historical period or for the last activity period, if the account balance is reconciled for all historical periods.
#*The balances disagree: You investigate the reasons, as described in [[#section_ky1_rmb_2t|Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances], and reconcile the account balance once again.
[anchor|#_f0d77834-bff7-443d-9403-2bafe45fe193]
==Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for the Last Activity Period==
After you have reconciled the balance of an inventory account for historical periods, you can start reconciling the balance of this account for the last activity period as follows:[anchor|#_ee8305c7-fa27-4a33-ae0f-71912c657db4]
#You find the ending balance for the account in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) report as follows:
##You run the report with ''Summary'' selected in the '''Format''' box.
##In the '''Total''' line of the report, you find the '''Total Cost''' value, which is the ending balance of the inventory account for the last activity period. You keep this value for further comparison.
#Optional: You review the inventory transactions and the ending balance of the inventory account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) form as follows:
##In the Summary area of the form, you do the following:
##*In the '''Inventory Account''' box, you select the inventory account for which you want to review transactions.
##*In the '''Period''' box, you select the last activity period.
##*You select the '''By Financial Period''' check box to filter the transactions by post period.
##In the '''Ending Balance''' column of the last table row, you find the ending balance for the inventory account and compare it with the balance found in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] report. The balances should be the same.
#You find the ending balance of the inventory account in the General Ledger by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\GL_63_20_00|Trial Balance Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) report as follows:
##You run the report with the following parameters:
##*'''Ledger ID''': Select the ledger with the ''Actual'' type.
##*'''Financial Period''': Select the last activity period.
##In the '''Ending Balance''' column for the inventory account, you find the ending balance.
#You compare the ending balance you found in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] report with the balance found in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\GL_63_20_00|Trial Balance Summary] report. You can receive one of the following results:
#*The balances agree: This means that the inventory account balance is reconciled for the last activity period. Now you can close these financial periods in the Inventory module; for details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Close_Financial_Period|To Close Financial Periods in Inventory].
#*The balances disagree: You investigate the reasons, as described in [[#section_ky1_rmb_2t|Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances], and reconcile the account balance once again.
[anchor|#section_ky1_rmb_2t]
==Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances ==
If the balances don&rsquo;t agree, you have to review every transaction in the Inventory and General Ledger modules to find the entries that do not match. You do the following:[anchor|#_ad9cde9d-c65f-4434-9fba-aff730b24f1f]
#Verify that all inventory transactions are posted in the General Ledger module by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) form. If there is an inventory transaction that is missing in the General Ledger account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_40_40_00|Account Details] ([~/?ScreenId=GL404000|GL404000]) form, you can do any of the following: 
#*Review the inventory transaction and make sure the General Ledger transaction has been generated for it. The transactions could be not generated if the '''Update GL''' check box was cleared when the inventory transaction was released.
#*Review the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_50_20_00|Post Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=GL502000|GL502000]) form to see if there are any ''Unposted'' batches of journal transactions. Process the needed transactions to eliminate the discrepancy.
#Check whether there are any transactions posted to the inventory account by other modules by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_40_40_00|Account Details] form. If there is a General Ledger transaction that is missing on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] form, open the batch of journal transactions and find the source document for it. Depending on the reason the General Ledger entry has been directly processed to the inventory account without the processing from the Inventory module, you can either correct the General Ledger transaction or process the missing inventory transaction in the Inventory module and reverse the generated batch to equate the balance of the inventory account in the modules.
((({S:Hint}If the '''Post Option''' is set to ''Detail'' for an inventory account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_25_00|Chart of Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) form, detailed journal entries are posted to the inventory account regardless of the Inventory module settings, and the General Ledger entries in the inventory account on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_40_40_00|Account Details] form can be matched one to one to the transaction lines on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] form. Otherwise, if the summary posting to the inventory account is configured for the General Ledger module, a number of inventory transaction lines will correspond to one summarized General Ledger entry. If you use summary posting to an inventory account in the General Ledger, we recommend that you specify unique sequence numbers for different inventory transaction types, so that you can group the inventory transaction lines by transaction type and reference number and match them one to one to the summarized General Ledger entries in the inventory account, if needed.
)))
After you have investigated the reasons for the disagreement, you can recalculate the balance of the inventory account, as described in the next section, to view changes in transactions on Inventory forms and reports.[anchor|#section_kpd_yz1_2t]
==Recalculation of the Inventory Account Balance==
You can run the inventory validation process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_50_00|Validate Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=IN505000|IN505000]) form to recalculate the inventory account balance for periods after you have corrected inventory transactions. (This process doesn't affect the on-hand quantity of items in inventory, because this quantity is updated with every released inventory transaction and tracked separately from the inventory account balance.) The inventory validation process performs the following operations:[anchor|#ol_h4l_qbb_2t]
#Recalculates the available quantity and the subtotals by allocation type that are stored in the database and that you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_10_00|Inventory Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) form. This operation is always performed when you run the process on the form.
#Clears all transaction history details for the inventory account in the Inventory module, which you can view in the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) report; the process then rebuilds the history again and recalculates the balance of the inventory account in the module by the released inventory transactions. To perform this operation, you have to select the '''Rebuild Item History''' check box on the form and specify the starting financial period. The system rebuilds the transaction history for each financial period starting from the specified one up to the last activity period in the module.
[anchor|#_eb01d874-4c04-4665-88ba-0ae3880b102b]
==Reports and Forms Used for Reconciliation in the Inventory module==
To review the ending balance of an inventory account for a historical period, you can use any of the following forms and reports:[anchor|#_efe4ed4b-b971-4fcd-b143-70b83fa3d929]
*[HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) report in the summary format: The summary report shows transaction summaries by inventory item, grouped by the account and subaccount to which the summarized transactions have been processed in the Inventory module. For each item, the summaries by period are presented for each period within the specified range. The first row of the summary shows the cost of the item for the account, subaccount, and period; the second row shows the quantity of the item. The '''Account/Subaccount Beginning Balance''' and '''Account/Subaccount Ending Balance''' lines show the beginning and ending balances on the subaccount for the selected period range. If you do not use subaccounts, the '''Account/Subaccount Ending Balance''' line shows the ending balance of the inventory account.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) form: With the inventory account and period selected in the Summary area, the form shows inventory transactions processed to the selected inventory account and financial period. Each record is an inventory transaction that corresponds to a line in the released inventory entry. The '''Beginning Balance''' and '''Ending Balance''' columns show running totals calculated by the listed transactions. If you specify additional filtering parameters on the form, the running totals are recalculated. '''Beginning Balance''' in the first row starts from the beginning balance of the inventory account for the selected period.
*:By default, the transaction lines are ordered by the transaction date (the '''Date''' column), then by the transaction type (the '''Tran. Type''' column), the reference number (the '''Reference Nbr.''' column), and the line number in the transaction.
*:'''Fin. Period''' shows the financial period that is specified in the '''Post Period''' of the inventory transaction. '''Tran. Period''' shows the financial period to which the transaction date belongs, which is not necessarily equal to the post period. The corresponding General Ledger transaction is posted to the '''Post Period''' of the inventory transaction.
*:The '''Period''' that you specify in the form settings filters transactions by the '''Post Period''' or '''Tran. Period''' of the transaction. If the '''By Financial Period''' check box is selected, the transactions are filtered by '''Post Period'''; otherwise, they are posted by '''Tran. Period'''. With the '''Start Date''' and '''End Date''' parameters on the form, you can also filter the transactions within the specified financial period.
*:In the last row, the '''Ending Balance''' column shows the ending balance of the account for the selected period.

To review the ending balance of an inventory account for the last activity period, you can use one of the following forms and reports:[anchor|#_ba859469-49ae-4a58-898c-0d1ab23c48ee]
*The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_70_00|Historical Inventory Valuation] report in the summary format
*The [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] form
* The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_61_55_00|Inventory Valuation] ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) report in the summary format: The report shows the ending balance of the inventory account for the last activity period in the Inventory module.

To review the ending balance of an inventory account in the General Ledger module, you use the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\GL_63_20_00|Trial Balance Summary] ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) report.

In the  Account/Subaccount Ending Balance  line of the report, you        find the ending balance of the account, which you reconcile, and record the balance. Optional: You review the inventory transactions and the ending balance of the inventory      account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account (IN403000) form as follows: In the Summary area of the form, you do the following: In the  Inventory Account  box, you select the inventory                   account for which you want to review transactions. In the  Period  box, you select the historical period. You select the  By Financial Period  check box to filter                   the transactions by post period. In the  Ending Balance  column of the last table row, you find the        ending balance for the inventory account and compare it with the balance found in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation report. The balances should be the same. You find the ending balance of the inventory account in the General Ledger by using the         ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) Trial Balance Summary (GL632000) report as follows: You run the report with the following parameters: Ledger ID : Select the ledger with the  Actual  type. Financial Period : Select the same historical period, for which                   you retrieved data from the Inventory module. In the  Ending Balance  column for the inventory account, you find               the ending balance. You compare the ending balance in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation report with the           balance in the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) Trial Balance Summary report. You can receive one of the           following results: The balances agree: This means that the inventory account balance is reconciled for               the selected period. You can start reconciling the same account for another historical               period or for the last activity period, if the account balance is reconciled for all               historical periods. The balances disagree: You investigate the reasons, as described in  Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances,               and reconcile the account balance once again. Reconciliation of the Inventory Account Balance for the Last Activity Period After you have reconciled the balance of an inventory account for historical periods, you can     start reconciling the balance of this account for the last activity period as follows: You find the ending balance for the account in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation      (IN615500) report as follows: You run the report with  Summary  selected in the  Format                box. In the  Total  line of the report, you find the  Total         Cost  value, which is the ending balance of the inventory account for the last        activity period. You keep this value for further comparison. Optional: You review the inventory transactions and the ending balance of the inventory      account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account (IN403000) form as follows: In the Summary area of the form, you do the following: In the  Inventory Account  box, you select the inventory                   account for which you want to review transactions. In the  Period  box, you select the last activity                   period. You select the  By Financial Period  check box to filter                   the transactions by post period. In the  Ending Balance  column of the last table row, you find the        ending balance for the inventory account and compare it with the balance found in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation report. The balances should be the same. You find the ending balance of the inventory account in the General Ledger by using the         ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) Trial Balance Summary (GL632000) report as follows: You run the report with the following parameters: Ledger ID : Select the ledger with the  Actual  type. Financial Period : Select the last activity period. In the  Ending Balance  column for the inventory account, you find               the ending balance. You compare the ending balance you found in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation report with      the balance found in the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) Trial Balance Summary report. You can receive one of the      following results: The balances agree: This means that the inventory account balance is reconciled for the               last activity period. Now you can close these financial periods in the Inventory               module; for details, see  To Close Financial Periods in Inventory. The balances disagree: You investigate the reasons, as described in  Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances, and        reconcile the account balance once again. Investigation of a Disagreement Between the Balances  If the balances don't agree, you have to review every transaction in the Inventory and         General Ledger modules to find the entries that do not match. You do the following: Verify that all inventory transactions are posted in the General Ledger module by using           the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account (IN403000) form. If there is an inventory transaction           that is missing in the General Ledger account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL404000|GL404000]) Account Details           (GL404000) form, you can do any of the following:  Review the inventory transaction and make sure the General Ledger transaction has               been generated for it. The transactions could be not generated if the                  Update GL  check box was cleared when the inventory               transaction was released. Review the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL502000|GL502000]) Post Transactions (GL502000) form to see if there are any                  Unposted  batches of journal transactions. Process the needed transactions to               eliminate the discrepancy. Check whether there are any transactions posted to the inventory account by other           modules by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL404000|GL404000]) Account Details form. If there is a General Ledger           transaction that is missing on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account form, open the batch of           journal transactions and find the source document for it. Depending on the reason the           General Ledger entry has been directly processed to the inventory account without the           processing from the Inventory module, you can either correct the General Ledger           transaction or process the missing inventory transaction in the Inventory module and           reverse the generated batch to equate the balance of the inventory account in the           modules. If the  Post Option  is set to  Detail  for an inventory         account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL202500|GL202500]) Chart of Accounts (GL202500) form, detailed journal entries are         posted to the inventory account regardless of the Inventory module settings, and the General         Ledger entries in the inventory account on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL404000|GL404000]) Account Details form can be         matched one to one to the transaction lines on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account form.         Otherwise, if the summary posting to the inventory account is configured for the General         Ledger module, a number of inventory transaction lines will correspond to one summarized         General Ledger entry. If you use summary posting to an inventory account in the General         Ledger, we recommend that you specify unique sequence numbers for different inventory         transaction types, so that you can group the inventory transaction lines by transaction type         and reference number and match them one to one to the summarized General Ledger entries in         the inventory account, if needed. After you have investigated the reasons for the disagreement, you can recalculate the         balance of the inventory account, as described in the next section, to view changes in         transactions on Inventory forms and reports. Recalculation of the Inventory Account Balance You can run the inventory validation process on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN505000|IN505000]) Validate Inventory (IN505000)         form to recalculate the inventory account balance for periods after you have corrected         inventory transactions. (This process doesn't affect the on-hand quantity of items in         inventory, because this quantity is updated with every released inventory transaction and         tracked separately from the inventory account balance.) The inventory validation process         performs the following operations: Recalculates the available quantity and the subtotals by allocation type that are stored in      the database and that you can view on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN401000|IN401000]) Inventory Summary (IN401000) form. This      operation is always performed when you run the process on the form. Clears all transaction history details for the inventory account in the Inventory module,           which you can view in the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation (IN617000) report; the process           then rebuilds the history again and recalculates the balance of the inventory account in           the module by the released inventory transactions. To perform this operation, you have to           select the  Rebuild Item History  check box on the form and specify           the starting financial period. The system rebuilds the transaction history for each           financial period starting from the specified one up to the last activity period in the           module. Reports and Forms Used for Reconciliation in the Inventory module To review the ending balance of an inventory account for a historical period, you can use any     of the following forms and reports:  ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation (IN617000) report in the summary format: The summary report           shows transaction summaries by inventory item, grouped by the account and subaccount to           which the summarized transactions have been processed in the Inventory module. For each           item, the summaries by period are presented for each period within the specified range.           The first row of the summary shows the cost of the item for the account, subaccount, and           period; the second row shows the quantity of the item. The  Account/Subaccount             Beginning Balance  and  Account/Subaccount Ending             Balance  lines show the beginning and ending balances on the subaccount for           the selected period range. If you do not use subaccounts, the              Account/Subaccount Ending Balance  line shows the ending balance           of the inventory account.  ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account (IN403000) form: With the inventory account and period           selected in the Summary area, the form shows inventory transactions processed to the           selected inventory account and financial period. Each record is an inventory transaction           that corresponds to a line in the released inventory entry. The  Beginning             Balance  and  Ending Balance  columns show running           totals calculated by the listed transactions. If you specify additional filtering           parameters on the form, the running totals are recalculated.  Beginning             Balance  in the first row starts from the beginning balance of the inventory           account for the selected period. By default, the transaction lines are ordered by the             transaction date (the  Date  column), then by the transaction type             (the  Tran. Type  column), the reference number (the                Reference Nbr.  column), and the line number in the             transaction. Fin. Period  shows the financial period that is             specified in the  Post Period  of the inventory transaction.                Tran. Period  shows the financial period to which the             transaction date belongs, which is not necessarily equal to the post period. The             corresponding General Ledger transaction is posted to the  Post               Period  of the inventory transaction. The                Period  that you specify in the form settings filters             transactions by the  Post Period  or  Tran.               Period  of the transaction. If the  By Financial               Period  check box is selected, the transactions are filtered by                Post Period ; otherwise, they are posted by  Tran.               Period . With the  Start Date  and  End               Date  parameters on the form, you can also filter the transactions within             the specified financial period. In the last row, the  Ending               Balance  column shows the ending balance of the account for the selected             period. To review the ending balance of an inventory account for the last activity period, you can use         one of the following forms and reports: The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN617000|IN617000]) Historical Inventory Valuation report in the summary format The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account form  The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN615500|IN615500]) Inventory Valuation (IN615500) report in the summary format: The report           shows the ending balance of the inventory account for the last activity period in the           Inventory module. To review the ending balance of an inventory account in the General Ledger module, you use the             ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) Trial Balance Summary (GL632000) report. ]]></column>

With Acumatica ERP, you can configure automated replenishment to cover many possible situations.((({S:Hint}The functionality that supports automated replenishment is available only if the ''Inventory Replenishment'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
Replenishment for stock items is performed on a per-warehouse basis. If your company has a single warehouse, it purchases inventory to replenish the stock directly in this warehouse. If your company has multiple warehouses (which is possible if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form), your company can consolidate purchase orders created for replenishment in smaller warehouses, perform purchasing to a single large warehouse (distribution center), and then transfer the purchased quantities from this distribution center to other warehouses. In other cases, the items can be purchased only to a larger warehouse and transferred to point-of-sale warehouses as needed. Some products at specific warehouses may be purchased only if there are customer orders requesting the products.{br}

By using forecast models, you can fine-tune such parameters as safety stock, reorder point, and maximum quantities based on sales statistics. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Configuration_of_Automated_Replenishment|Configuration of Automated Replenishment].{br}{TOC}
==Replenishment Preparation==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form, you can view the list of items that require replenishment. To more effectively process the requests, you can select a warehouse and a planned purchase date, and view the list of applicable items requiring replenishment in this warehouse on a specified date. You can further narrow the list by a specific vendor, or you can view only the items assigned to you as a product manager or to your workgroup.{br}

You can select particular items and process them by clicking '''Process''', or you can process all the listed items by clicking '''Process All''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form.
==Conditions to Initiate Replenishment for a Stock Item==
To create the list of items that require replenishment, the system uses the settings specified on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form for each item at each warehouse where the item can be stocked.{br}

An item is listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form if the following general conditions are fulfilled: 
*The processing date you&rsquo;ve selected is within the time interval when the replenishment settings are effective (defined by '''Launch Date''' and '''Termination Date''').
*The available quantity is below the reorder point for this item at this warehouse.
*The item has one of the following sources: 
**''Purchase'': The item stock should be replenished through a purchase. The system will generate a replenishment request for purchasing. By default, the preferred vendor specified on the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form will be used on the order, but you can select another vendor. 
**''Transfer'': The quantity required for item replenishment should be transferred from a replenishment warehouse. The system will generate a replenishment request for transfer. 

If an item should be replenished by using the ''Fixed'' replenishment method, the system will generate a replenishment request for the following quantity:[anchor|#ul_kqv_3hf_5q]
*If the replenishment source is ''Transfer'', the transfer economic order quantity (transfer EOQ).
*If the source is ''Purchase'', the economic order quantity (EOQ) specified for the selected vendor on the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form. 

If the item should be replenished by using the ''Min./Max.'' replenishment method, the system will generate a replenishment request for the target quantity, which is calculated as follows: {{{{Target Quantity = Max. Quantity - Quantity on Hand - Quantity on Supply + Quantity on Demand
}}}}
The ''quantity on demand'' is calculated based on the sales orders, transfers, and kit assembly documents (of the ''Production'' type) in accordance with the method of demand calculation, which is selected in the '''Demand Calculation''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. If the ''Item Class Settings'' option is selected, the demand will be calculated in accordance with the availability settings specified for this item class on the '''General Settings''' tab of the same form; if the ''Hard Demand Only'' option is selected, the demand will be calculated as ''Qty. SO Allocated + Qty. SO Shipped + Qty. SO Back-Ordered''. {br}

The ''quantity on supply'' is calculated based on purchase receipts, transfer receipts, and kit assembly documents (of the ''Disassembly'' type) according to the availability settings specified for this item&rsquo;s class. {br}

The replenishment quantities on the list appear adjusted for low seasons defined by your system&rsquo;s set of seasonality settings. By using seasonality settings, you can adjust the quantities for replenishment that are initiated during low seasons, each of which is defined by its starting and ending date. For a purchase date within a low season, the replenishment quantity is calculated with a ''decreasing factor'', which is a factor that appropriately decreases replenishment quantities. 
==Replenishment Request Handling==
When you process the items listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form, the system is prompted to create appropriate replenishment requests, which are internal Acumatica ERP documents used as the basis for creating purchase and transfer orders. Replenishment requests have reference numbers, which are determined by the numbering sequence specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.{br}

The system handles replenishment requests differently based on the item replenishment source: 
*''Purchase'': Replenishment requests for items with this replenishment source appear on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form, which you can use to create one order for all items to be purchased from a specific vendor. The system will perform any needed conversions to purchase units. 
*:If the ''Min./Max.'' method has been chosen for the item, the system computes the replenishment quantity as the difference between the maximum quantity and the quantity on hand, minus the quantity on supply (the quantity of items on unreleased purchase orders, purchase receipts, and quantities in transit), and plus the quantity on demand (on customer released and unreleased orders). If the ''Fixed Order Quantity'' method has been selected, the system uses the EOQ values specified for the selected vendor.
*''Transfer'': (This type of source is available only if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.) Replenishment requests for items with this replenishment source appear on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_90_00|Create Transfer Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) form. You create transfer orders to move the products from the replenishment warehouse to the warehouse when the item needs replenishment.

==Calculation of the Final Replenishment Quantities==
The quantities specified on the purchase order may differ from those specified on the replenishment requests. The final replenishment quantity for an item on a purchase order is calculated based on the settings provided for the vendor that will fulfill replenishment, and the following changes may occur: 
*If the quantity required by replenishment settings is less than the minimum order quantity, the system uses the minimum order quantity.
*If the quantity required by replenishment settings exceeds the maximum order quantity, the system uses the maximum order quantity. (The maximum order quantity is not used in the current version.)
*If the requested quantity is not divisible by the lot size, the result is rounded up to the next integer, and that number of lots is ordered.

The system handles replenishment requests differently based on the item replenishment 				source:  Purchase : Replenishment requests for items with this replenishment source appear on 					the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) Create Purchase Orders (PO505000) form, which you can 					use to create one order for all items to be purchased from a specific vendor. 					The system will perform any needed conversions to purchase units.  If the 							 Min./Max.  method has been chosen for the item, the system 						computes the replenishment quantity as the difference between the maximum 						quantity and the quantity on hand, minus the quantity on supply (the 						quantity of items on unreleased purchase orders, purchase receipts, and 						quantities in transit), and plus the quantity on demand (on customer 						released and unreleased orders). If the  Fixed Order Quantity  method 						has been selected, the system uses the EOQ values specified for the selected 						vendor. Transfer : (This type of source is available only if the  Multiple Warehouses  					feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.) 					Replenishment requests for items with this replenishment source appear on the 						  ([~/?ScreenId=SO509000|SO509000]) Create Transfer Orders (SO509000) form. You create 					transfer orders to move the products from the replenishment warehouse to the 					warehouse when the item needs replenishment. Calculation of the Final Replenishment Quantities The quantities specified on the purchase order may differ from those specified on the 				replenishment requests. The final replenishment quantity for an item on a purchase 				order is calculated based on the settings provided for the vendor that will fulfill 				replenishment, and the following changes may occur:  If the quantity required by replenishment settings is less than the minimum 					order quantity, the system uses the minimum order quantity. If the quantity required by replenishment settings exceeds the maximum order 					quantity, the system uses the maximum order quantity. (The maximum order 					quantity is not used in the current version.) If the requested quantity is not divisible by the lot size, the result is 					rounded up to the next integer, and that number of lots is ordered.

To be competitive, a company must strike a balance with its inventory levels: The company should not overstock inventory, because this ties up working capital, yet it should avoid stockouts, which result in lost customers and diminished customer loyalty. {br}

With Acumatica ERP, you can configure automatic replenishment for stock items at a single warehouse, or at multiple warehouses (if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form). If your warehouses may be used only for sales, you can configure the system so that the warehouses from which sales are performed will be replenished from the warehouses where purchases are performed (from distribution centers).{br}

Before you start to configure automated replenishment in your system, thoroughly consider the warehouse functions in your system, including which warehouses will perform consolidated purchasing, which will serve as replenishment sources for other warehouses, which will be replenished by transfers, and which will be replenished by direct purchasing. For more information about replenishment, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Automated_Replenishment|Automated Replenishment].{br}{TOC}
==Configuration Steps==
To reduce time that would be spent typing replenishment settings for each item in each warehouse, you can configure default replenishment settings at multiple levels.{br}

In general, you perform the following steps to configure automated replenishment: 
#You create the appropriate replenishment classes, which group warehouses by the replenishment sources used in your company. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Replenishment_Class|To Create a Replenishment Class].
#You create replenishment seasonality entities. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Create_Replenishment_Seasonality|To Create a Replenishment Seasonality].
#You assign each warehouse to a replenishment class. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Specify_Replenishment_Class_in_Warehouse_Settings|To Assign a Replenishment Class to a Warehouse].
#For each item class, you specify replenishment settings for all replenishment classes, including the applicable seasonality settings. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Set_Up_Replenishment_for_Item_Class|To Set Up Replenishment for an Item Class].
#For each stock item, you review the replenishment settings that are the default values from the item class, and make any needed adjustments. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Set_Up_Replenishment_for_Stock_Item|To Set Up Replenishment for a Stock Item].
#For each stock item at each specific warehouse, you review the replenishment settings that are the default values from the item. Adjust these settings for each warehouse if needed. For details, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__how_Set_Up_Item_Warehouse_Replenishment|To Specify Warehouse-Specific Replenishment Settings for a Stock Item].

The sections below provide information that will help you execute these steps.
==Replenishment Classes==
Replenishment classes categorize warehouses by their ''replenishment source''—that is, how stock is replenished at the warehouse. You assign a replenishment class to every warehouse.{br}

You create replenishment classes by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_88_00|Replenishment Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208800|IN208800]) form; for each class, you specify its name, description, and replenishment source. As the replenishment source, you can select one of the following options:
*''None'': No replenishment is required for a warehouse. This option could be used, for example, for a warehouse that is closing its operations.
*''Purchase'': The items for stock replenishment in the warehouse will be purchased from vendors when it is determined by the replenishment settings and in the quantities calculated based on the replenishment settings.
*''Transfer'': For stock replenishment in a warehouse, the items will be transferred from a source warehouse; transfer orders will be generated automatically. This option is available only if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
*''Purchase to Order'': In warehouses with this replenishment source option selected, no actual replenishment is performed; the items are purchased only when customer orders have been received and strictly in the quantities requested by the orders. When you add an item from this warehouse to a sales order, the system automatically selects the '''Mark for PO''' check box so that a purchase order for this item can be created.
*''Drop-Shipment'': In warehouses with this replenishment source option selected, no actual replenishment is performed; the items are purchased only when customer orders have been received and strictly in the quantities requested by the orders. When you add an item from this warehouse to a sales order, the system automatically selects the '''Mark for PO''' check box so that a purchase order for the item can be created; the purchased item is sent directly to the customer.
((({S:Hint}For automated replenishment, only replenishment classes with ''Purchase'' or ''Transfer'' as replenishment sources can be used.
)))
==Setting Up Default Values==
To make it easier to provide replenishment settings for each item that are specific to each warehouse where the item is stocked, you can set up default values at multiple levels:
#Item class: By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, on the '''Replenishment Settings''' tab, you specify the replenishment settings to be used as the default settings for items of the class. If you know that items of the class are stocked at multiple warehouses with different replenishment sources, configure how the items are typically replenished for each replenishment class. For each item class, you specify the following information: 
#*The method of demand calculation, which you select in the '''Demand Calculation''' box. If you select ''Hard Demand Only'', the demand will be calculated as ''Qty. SO Allocated + Qty. SO Shipped + Qty. SO Back-Ordered''. If you select ''Item Class Settings'', the demand will be calculated in accordance with the availability settings specified for this item class on the '''General Settings''' tab of the same form.
#*The seasonality.
#*The replenishment method: ''None'', ''Min/Max'', or ''Fixed Reorder Qty''. For the second or third option, specify the parameter (the ''reorder point'' quantity) required to determine the need for replenishment.
#*The demand forecast model and parameters for the model (the period type, number of periods to analyze, and service level).
#*The launch and termination dates of the period when the settings are effective for the class.
#:((({S:Hint}The default replenishment settings for a newly created item class are those from the parent item class. If the created item class has no parent, the default replenishment settings are those of the class that is specified in the '''Default Stock Item Class''' box (if you are creating a stock item class) or the '''Default Non-Stock Item Class''' box (if you are creating a non-stock item class) box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.
)))
#Stock item: On the '''Replenishment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you can view the replenishment settings of a particular item, which by default are provided by the item class. For the item, you can review the replenishment settings for different replenishment classes that might be used if the item is stocked at multiple warehouses, and override the settings if needed.
#Subitem: If subitems are used in your system, on the '''Replenishment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form, you should specify parameters for each subitem. If only the default subitem is used with for the item, you specify the parameters for this default subitem; if different subitems of the item require different replenishment quantities, you specify the parameters that are different. Subitems inherit all other replenishment settings from the item.

==Replenishment Settings for an Item at a Particular Warehouse==
The many replenishment settings for all items at all warehouses are filled in with default values. On the '''Replenishment Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, you can review the replenishment parameters to be used for the particular item at the selected warehouse. These settings come from the item settings but can be overridden for this item stocked in a particular warehouse. ((({S:Hint}For the item, you cannot use a replenishment source other than the one specified for the warehouse where the item is stocked.
)))
Also, you can override the values of the replenishment parameters used for particular subitems, if in this warehouse they differ from the default values specified for subitems on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form.
==Configuration of Consolidated Purchasing for Replenishment==
With Acumatica ERP, you can configure replenishment for a number of warehouses that is performed by centralized purchasing to one large warehouse, a distribution center, and by transfers to smaller warehouses—this ensures that purchasing is performed more efficiently.{br}

You have to make sure that for items in the warehouse (which is a distribution center), ''Purchase'' is selected as the replenishment source on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form with no replenishment warehouse selected. For items in the smaller warehouses (which should be replenished by purchasing to a distribution center), you specify ''Purchase'' as the replenishment source and select the distribution center as the replenishment warehouse on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form.{br}

First, you must prepare replenishment requests for small warehouses by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form and generate transfer orders requesting replenishment by using the form. After that, you will be able to generate purchase orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form—the system will create a single purchase order for all the requested quantities of each item. Additionally, you can run the process of preparing replenishment in the distribution center before you generate consolidated purchase orders for smaller warehouses, to add to consolidated purchase orders the quantities requested for replenishment in the distribution center. Upon receipt of the items (once receipts are released), you will be able to replenish the stock in the distribution center and to fulfill transfer orders by the appropriate number of shipments to all the demand warehouses.{br}

If the item is replenished by using the ''Purchase to Order'' source, for each warehouse where the item is stocked, you can specify the same replenishment warehouse. Then, when you generate purchase orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] form, the system will create a single purchase order for all the requested quantities of the item, no matter what are the demand warehouses. After you create a receipt for the merchandise from a vendor for this purchase order and release it, the system automatically generates transfer orders to split the received quantity between demand warehouses according to the quantities on the original sales orders.
==Configuration of Replenishment by Transfers==
If the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can configure replenishment for a number of warehouses that is performed by transfers from one large warehouse, a distribution center, for which centralized purchasing is performed, and perform purchasing efficiently.{br}

For items in the smaller warehouses that should be replenished by transfers from the distribution center, specify ''Transfer'' as the replenishment source, while for the same items stocked in the distribution center, select ''Purchase'' as the replenishment source.{br}

First, you must prepare replenishment for small warehouses by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_80_00|Prepare Replenishment] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508000|IN508000]) form and generate transfer orders requesting replenishment—this will create demand for replenishment in the distribution center. After that, you will be able to generate replenishment requests for the distribution center. The next stage in the replenishment process is generating purchase orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_50_50_00|Create Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO505000|PO505000]) form—the system will create a single purchase order for all the requested quantities of each item. Upon receipt of the items (once receipts are released), you will be able to fulfill transfer orders by appropriate number of shipments.

As the replenishment source, you can select 				one of the following options: None : No replenishment is required for a warehouse. This option could be 					used, for example, for a warehouse that is closing its operations. Purchase : The items for stock replenishment in the warehouse will be 					purchased from vendors when it is determined by the replenishment settings and 					in the quantities calculated based on the replenishment settings.

With Acumatica ERP, you can assign different replenishment methods to different items of inventory stocked at a single warehouse or different warehouses and specify warehouse-specific parameters for these methods. Different items may require different parameters because of different customer demand for them and different numbers of days required to receive the requested quantities from the vendors.{br}

You can use either of the following replenishment methods: ''Min./Max.'' or ''Fixed Order Qty''. For each stock item, the system uses the specified method to calculate the quantities required to replenish the stock of this item, based on the replenishment parameters that you specify on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form. {br}

The available replenishment methods and their parameters are discussed in the sections below. {br}{TOC}
==Min./Max. Method==
You use the ''Min./Max.'' method to maintain the stock level of an inventory item at a particular warehouse between the specified minimum and maximum quantities. To use this method for an item, you should specify the following parameters: [anchor|#ul_wmd_pvt_l3]
*'''Maximum Quantity''': This is the maximum stock quantity allowed for the item at the warehouse. 
*'''Safety Stock''': This is the additional stock of the item maintained to avoid stockouts. A safety stock is required if there are fluctuations in demand and supply. Because safety stock is not used in calculation for this method, add the quantity of the safety stock to both ''maximum quantity'' and ''reorder point quantity''. 
*'''Reorder Point''': The system uses the reorder point quantity in the ''Min./Max.'' replenishment method rather than a minimum quantity. The quantity to be used as the minimum quantity is specified in the '''Reorder Point''' column on '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Generally, the reorder point quantity would be estimated as the quantity that may be required during the lead time (the time when the product is being shipped from the vendor location to your company). If you need to maintain safety stock, include the safety stock quantity in the reorder point quantity.

Once the system detects that current stock level (the available quantity) of the particular item has reached or fallen below the reorder point, it calculates the quantity required to replenish the item stock up to the maximum quantity by adding the quantity on demand to the difference between quantities of the maximum, on hand, and on supply. You control the way the system calculates the quantities on demand for classes of stock items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form as follows:[anchor|#ul_td1_xcw_bq]
*''Hard Demand Only'': For all stock items of the class, the demand is calculated as ''(Qty.SO Allocated) + (Qty SO Back-Ordered) + (Qty SO Shipped)''
* ''Item Class Settings'': For all stock items of the class, the demand is calculated in accordance with the availability options selected for the item class on the '''General Settings '''tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] form.

==Fixed Order Quantity Method==
You use the ''Fixed Order Quantity'' method when you want to replenish the item stock with a fixed quantity each time it falls below the reorder point. This method uses the following parameters: [anchor|#ul_t2p_2w5_l3]
*'''Fixed Quantity''': We recommend that you use as the fixed quantity the '' economical order quantity (EOQ)'' determined by warehouse specialists for a particular item by estimating the cost of ordering the item from a particular vendor. For each vendor from which the stock item can be purchased, the EOQ is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_20_10_00|Vendor Inventory] ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) form. You can view EOQs specified for all vendors of the item on the '''Vendor Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form.
*'''Safety Stock''': This is the additional stock of the item maintained to avoid stockouts. The safety stock is required if there are fluctuations in demand and supply.
*'''Reorder Point''': For this method, too, the reorder point is specified as the safety stock plus the quantity that may be required during the lead time.

With the ''Fixed Order Quantity'' method, the system generates request for the economical order quantity (EOQ) for the item once it determines that the available quantity reaches or is lower than the reorder point. 
==Parameter Estimation==
For automated replenishment, you can manually enter estimates of replenishment parameters—such as safety stock, maximum quantity, and reorder point—that were made externally by logistics specialists for each item. Alternatively, you can configure the system to automatically calculate the replenishment parameters.{br}

 In Acumatica ERP, you can use demand forecast models to calculate replenishment parameters by using sales statistics. For overview of the functionality, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Replenishment_Based_on_Demand_Forecast_Model|Replenishment Parameters Based on Demand Forecast ]. With this flexibility, you can lower carrying costs, avoid stockouts, minimize excess or obsolete inventory, improve cash flow, and increase customer loyalty levels. 
==Other Item-Specific Parameters==
The parameters described below are also used in automated replenishment for the inventory item at the specific warehouse:
*'''Launch and Termination Dates''': These dates define the range during which the replenishment settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form will affect the item if it is stocked at this warehouse. By default, the dates come from the item settings (which are specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form but can be overridden for the item at the specific warehouse).
*'''Vendor Details''': To replenish the stock of the inventory item at the warehouse, you should specify the vendor from which inventory will be purchased. The system uses the default vendor of the inventory item (as specified on the '''Vendor Details '''tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form) unless you have selected another vendor for the item at the warehouse. The following item-specific parameters are associated with the selected preferred vendor: 
**The lead time required to ship the item from the vendor location to the warehouse
**The lot size, if specified, which rounds up the order quantity for the mix/max method to multiples of lot size
**The minimum order frequency (the minimum number of days between two successive orders)
**The minimum and maximum order quantity
**The EOQ

==Subitem Details==
If your company uses subitems in your implementation of Acumatica ERP, you can also specify the replenishment parameters for each subitem of the item stored at the warehouse. {br}

On the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, you can generate the list of all subitems of the inventory item. By default, all subitems have the same parameter values, copied from the values for the default subitem. On the '''Subitem Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, you can create a list of subitems stocked at the warehouse and specify replenishment parameters for each subitem. {br}

Separate replenishment quantities will be calculated for each subitem, based on subitem-specific parameters and the current quantity on hand (of the item with this subitem) at the warehouse.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Replenishment Methods and Their Parameters With  Acumatica ERP, you can assign different replenishment methods to different items of inventory                 stocked at a single warehouse or different warehouses and specify warehouse-specific                 parameters for these methods. Different items may require different parameters                 because of different customer demand for them and different numbers of days required                 to receive the requested quantities from the vendors. You can use either of the following replenishment methods:  Min./Max.  or                      Fixed Order Qty . For each stock item, the system uses the specified                 method to calculate the quantities required to replenish the stock of this item,                 based on the replenishment parameters that you specify on the                      Replenishment Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details (IN204500) form.  The available replenishment methods and their parameters are discussed in the                 sections below.  Min./Max. Method You use the  Min./Max.  method to maintain the stock level of an inventory item                 at a particular warehouse between the specified minimum and maximum quantities. To                 use this method for an item, you should specify the following parameters:  Maximum Quantity : This is the maximum stock quantity                     allowed for the item at the warehouse.  Safety Stock : This is the additional stock of the item                     maintained to avoid stockouts. A safety stock is required if there are                     fluctuations in demand and supply. Because safety stock is not used in                     calculation for this method, add the quantity of the safety stock to both                          maximum quantity  and  reorder point quantity .  Reorder Point : The system uses the reorder point quantity                     in the  Min./Max.  replenishment method rather than a minimum quantity. The                     quantity to be used as the minimum quantity is specified in the                          Reorder Point  column on  Replenishment                         Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)                     form. Generally, the reorder point quantity would be estimated as the quantity                     that may be required during the lead time (the time when the product is being                     shipped from the vendor location to your company). If you need to maintain                     safety stock, include the safety stock quantity in the reorder point                     quantity. Once the system detects that current stock level (the available quantity) of the                 particular item has reached or fallen below the reorder point, it calculates the                 quantity required to replenish the item stock up to the maximum quantity by adding                 the quantity on demand to the difference between quantities of the maximum, on hand,                 and on supply. You control the way the system calculates the quantities on demand                 for classes of stock items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes                 (IN204500) form as follows: Hard Demand Only : For all stock items of the class, the demand is                     calculated as  (Qty.SO Allocated) + (Qty SO Back-Ordered) + (Qty SO                         Shipped) Item Class Settings : For all stock items of the class, the demand is                     calculated in accordance with the availability options selected for the item                     class on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes form. Fixed Order Quantity Method You use the  Fixed Order Quantity  method when you want to replenish the item                 stock with a fixed quantity each time it falls below the reorder point. This method                 uses the following parameters:  Fixed Quantity : We recommend that you use as the fixed                     quantity the   economical order quantity (EOQ)  determined by warehouse                     specialists for a particular item by estimating the cost of ordering the item                     from a particular vendor. For each vendor from which the stock item can be                     purchased, the EOQ is specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO201000|PO201000]) Vendor Inventory (PO201000) form. You can view EOQs specified for all                     vendors of the item on the  Vendor Details  tab of the                           ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form. Safety Stock : This is the additional stock of the item                     maintained to avoid stockouts. The safety stock is required if there are                     fluctuations in demand and supply. Reorder Point : For this method, too, the reorder point is                     specified as the safety stock plus the quantity that may be required during the                     lead time. With the  Fixed Order Quantity  method, the system generates request for the                 economical order quantity (EOQ) for the item once it determines that the available                 quantity reaches or is lower than the reorder point.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
Businesses strive to have enough stock for potential sales. Replenishing the stock in time and in the proper quantities helps businesses to retain customers while reducing storage costs. For an overview of the automated replenishment functionality implemented in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Automated_Replenishment|Automated Replenishment]. To predict the demand—that is, the stock level you may need in the future for each item—you can use demand forecast methods. The current version of Acumatica ERP uses the ''moving average'' method, one of the simplest methods.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can use the predicted average daily demand, calculated with the help of demand forecasting models, to periodically update the values of replenishment parameters (such as maximum quantity, reorder point, and safety stock) in order to more precisely calculate the quantities required for replenishment. {br}{TOC}
==Using the Moving Average Method==
 With the moving average method, you calculate the demand for a specific future period based on historical sales data for multiple consecutive periods in the immediate past. This method works well for items with specific trends in sales or with stable sales not subjected to random significant fluctuations. {br}

To apply the moving average method to forecasting demand, you select the specific time period (a week, a month, or a quarter) and the number of these periods to analyze the data, depending on how the sales of the particular product or group of products (implemented in Acumatica ERP as an item class) change over time. This forecast model uses the data available for the specified number of past periods to forecast demand for the period immediately following the last period whose data is used in forecasting. If you select a month as the forecast period and want to perform a forecast on the 15th day of the current month, 15 days&rsquo; worth of data will not be used for forecasting; only data from full periods is used. The system calculates the daily demand for the nearest future period based on daily sales in all days of the specified number of prior periods.{br}

As the actual data for the last forecast period becomes available, you can forecast the demand for the next period by using the data of the previous periods shifted by one period. This method smooths out the data; the more periods you use to calculate the average demand, the greater the smoothing effect.{br}

The ''average lead time'' is calculated for each stock item‒preferred vendor pair based on all purchase orders in the system history. The average lead time is computed as average difference (on all orders) between the date when an order is created (the '''Requested on''' date) and the date of the receipt created for the goods listed on the order.
==Using Seasonality Parameters for Forecasting==
The sales of some products follow certain cycles or patterns. For example, the peak of ski sales is in the winter. These patterns in sales can be described as ''seasonality''. A set of seasonality settings is a list of low and high seasons with appropriate factors (coefficients) that show how sales decline or increase in each of these specific seasons, as compared to average sales volumes calculated over all time. The seasons for particular products or groups of products with similar sales behavior and corresponding factors can be determined by analyzing sales data spanning several financial years. {br}

You define seasonality settings by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_66_00|Replenishment Seasonality] ([~/?ScreenId=IN206600|IN206600]) form. The seasons for one seasonality should not intersect. For date ranges not included in any season, the factor is 1.0 by default. A low season for groups of products may span multiple financial periods or be contained in a single financial period.{br}

The seasonality settings are used as follows: [anchor|#ol_ucn_fsl_b3]
#The system normalizes the historical data available for the specified seasons. The sales volumes for each day of a season are deleted by the appropriate factor to calculate the sales quantities as though it were a normal season.
#The system calculates the average daily sales quantity based on the historical data of the specified number of periods. For seasons within the specified periods, the system uses the normalized data.
#:((({S:Hint}The standard deviation for the daily demand is calculated for actual sales data, not for normalized data.
)))
#The average daily sales quantity is adjusted for seasons if seasons are expected within the forecast period. The average daily sales is multiplied by the average seasonality factor (calculated over all days in the forecast period—normal days and days of seasons).

==Calculating Replenishment Parameters==
By using the calculated average daily demand (daily sales), average lead time, and their standard deviation values, the system computes the following parameters used in automated replenishment: ''' Reorder Point''' and '''Safety Stock'''.{{{{(ReorderPoint) = (AverageDailyDailyDemand)*(AverageLeadTime) + (SafetyStock)
}}}}The safety stock is calculated as follows to address possible fluctuations in demand (daily sales):{{{{(SafetyStock) = Normsinv (ServiceLevel)*    
                        SQRT((AverageLeadTime * STDEV(DailyDemand))^2 + (AverageDailyDemand * STDEV(LeadTime))^2)
}}}}
To understand this calculation, note the following:[anchor|#ul_w2k_5b4_ft]
*{{AverageDailyDemand}} is the average daily demand (average daily sales), calculated as the item quantity on all sales orders, credit memos, transfers out, and kit assembly documents in all the time periods used to analyze the data divided by the number of days.
*{{STDEV(DailyDemand)}} is the standard deviation of daily demand (daily sales quantity) from the average quantity.
*{{AverageLeadTime}} is the average lead time (in days) calculated based on the purchases in all the time periods used to analyze the data.
*{{STDEV(LeadTime)}} is the standard deviation of lead time (in days) from the average value.
*{{Normsinv(ServiceLevel)}} is the service factor, which is calculated based on the service level specified as a percentage. 
*:The service level is used to optimize the safety stock level. Generally, it is set on the item-class level, but it can be specified for each item in each warehouse if needed. The service level represents the probability of stockout not being reached. The {{Normsinv(ServiceLevel)}} function provides the factor that adjusts the safety stock required for the specified service level. With the service level selected at 50%, the safety stock is zero (that is, not required). The factor reaches 1.0 with the service level approximately 84%, which is the default value for the service level on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form. To maintain a higher service level, you will need a safety stock that exceeds the calculated quantity.
{br}

For an example of the calculation of the replenishment parameters for the moving average method, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Example_Replenishment_Calculation|An Example of Replenishment Parameter Calculation].{br}

The '''Maximum Stock''' is set equal to '''Reorder Point'''; if needed, you can manually increase the value of '''Maximum Stock'''.
==Setting Up Parameter Calculation==
You specify the forecast method and its parameters for each item class by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, and then the settings are used as default values for items of the class. You can select values that differ from the default ones for particular items of the class by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Moreover, if the ''Multiple Warehouses'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can adjust the replenishment settings for each warehouse in which the items are stocked. 
==Splitting Parameters by Subitems==
If subitems are used in your system, you can use demand forecasting to calculate replenishment parameters for specific subitems of the items if having enough stock for these subitems is important to your business. For such items, on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, specify the initial replenishment parameters for each of the subitems used. After that, the system will calculate parameters for each listed subitem by using the forecasted daily demand (daily sales) for the specific subitem.((({S:Hint}All subitems of the item should be listed in the '''Subitem Replenishment Parameters''' table. If specific subitems do not require replenishment, specify zero values as their parameters.
)))
==Updating Replenishment Parameters by Using Forecast-based Values==
You use the following Acumatica ERP forms to update replenishment parameters and then prepare the replenishment:[anchor|#ul_xpj_xrf_j3]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_85_00|Calculate Replenishment Parameters] ([~/?ScreenId=IN508500|IN508500]): You use this form to compute the average daily sales and average lead time, and then to calculate the following parameters used in automated replenishment: '''Max. Qty.''', ''' Reorder Point''', and '''Safety Stock'''.
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_95_00|Apply Replenishment Parameters] ([~/?ScreenId=IN509500|IN509500]): On this form, you review the parameter values suggested by the forecast and replace the old values of replenishment parameters with the suggested (calculated) ones.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Replenishment Parameters Based on Demand Forecast  Businesses strive to have enough stock for potential sales. Replenishing the stock in 				time and in the proper quantities helps businesses to retain customers while 				reducing storage costs. For an overview of the automated replenishment functionality 				implemented in  Acumatica ERP, see  Automated Replenishment. To predict the 				demand—that is, the stock level you may need in the future for each 				item—you can use demand forecast methods. The current version of  Acumatica ERP uses the  moving average  method, one of the simplest methods. In  Acumatica ERP, you can use the predicted average daily demand, calculated with the help of 				demand forecasting models, to periodically update the values of replenishment 				parameters (such as maximum quantity, reorder point, and safety stock) in order to 				more precisely calculate the quantities required for replenishment.  Using the Moving Average Method  With the moving average method, you calculate the demand for a specific future period based 				on historical sales data for multiple consecutive periods in the immediate past. 				This method works well for items with specific trends in sales or with stable sales 				not subjected to random significant fluctuations.  To apply the moving average method to forecasting demand, you select the specific time period 				(a week, a month, or a quarter) and the number of these periods to analyze the data, 				depending on how the sales of the particular product or group of products 				(implemented in  Acumatica ERP as an item class) change over time. This forecast model uses the data available 				for the specified number of past periods to forecast demand for the period 				immediately following the last period whose data is used in forecasting. If you 				select a month as the forecast period and want to perform a forecast on the 15th day 				of the current month, 15 days' worth of data will not be used for forecasting; only 				data from full periods is used. The system calculates the daily demand for the 				nearest future period based on daily sales in all days of the specified number of 				prior periods. As the actual data for the last forecast period becomes available, you can forecast the demand 				for the next period by using the data of the previous periods shifted by one period. 				This method smooths out the data; the more periods you use to calculate the average 				demand, the greater the smoothing effect. The  average lead time  is calculated for each stock item‒preferred vendor pair 				based on all purchase orders in the system history. The average lead time is 				computed as average difference (on all orders) between the date when an order is 				created (the  Requested on  date) and the date of the receipt 				created for the goods listed on the order. Using Seasonality Parameters for Forecasting The sales of some products follow certain cycles or patterns. For example, the peak of ski 				sales is in the winter. These patterns in sales can be described as 					 seasonality . A set of seasonality settings is a list of low and high 				seasons with appropriate factors (coefficients) that show how sales decline or 				increase in each of these specific seasons, as compared to average sales volumes 				calculated over all time. The seasons for particular products or groups of products 				with similar sales behavior and corresponding factors can be determined by analyzing 				sales data spanning several financial years.  You define seasonality settings by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN206600|IN206600]) Replenishment Seasonality (IN206600) 				form. The seasons for one seasonality should not intersect. For date ranges not 				included in any season, the factor is 1.0 by default. A low season for groups of 				products may span multiple financial periods or be contained in a single financial 				period. The seasonality settings are used as follows:  The system normalizes the historical data available for the specified seasons. 					The sales volumes for each day of a season are deleted by the appropriate factor 					to calculate the sales quantities as though it were a normal season. The system calculates the average daily sales quantity based on the historical 					data of the specified number of periods. For seasons within the specified 					periods, the system uses the normalized data. The standard deviation for the daily demand is calculated for actual 							sales data, not for normalized data. The average daily sales quantity is adjusted for seasons if seasons are expected 					within the forecast period. The average daily sales is multiplied by the average 					seasonality factor (calculated over all days in the forecast period—normal 					days and days of seasons). Calculating Replenishment Parameters By using the calculated average 				daily demand (daily sales), average lead time, and their standard deviation values, 				the system computes the following parameters used in automated replenishment: 					  Reorder Point  and  Safety 				Stock . (ReorderPoint) = (AverageDailyDailyDemand)*(AverageLeadTime) + (SafetyStock) The 			safety stock is calculated as follows to address possible fluctuations in demand (daily 				sales): (SafetyStock) = Normsinv (ServiceLevel)*    
                        SQRT((AverageLeadTime * STDEV(DailyDemand))^2 + (AverageDailyDemand * STDEV(LeadTime))^2) To 				understand this calculation, note the following: AverageDailyDemand  is the average daily demand (average 						daily sales), calculated as the item quantity on all sales orders, credit 						memos, transfers out, and kit assembly documents in all the time periods 						used to analyze the data divided by the number of days. STDEV(DailyDemand)  is the standard deviation of daily 						demand (daily sales quantity) from the average quantity. AverageLeadTime  is the average lead time (in days) 						calculated based on the purchases in all the time periods used to analyze 						the data. STDEV(LeadTime)  is the standard deviation of lead time (in 						days) from the average value. Normsinv(ServiceLevel)  is the service factor, which is 						calculated based on the service level specified as a percentage.  The 							service level is used to optimize the safety stock level. Generally, it 							is set on the item-class level, but it can be specified for each item in 							each warehouse if needed. The service level represents the probability 							of stockout not being reached. The 								 Normsinv(ServiceLevel)  function provides the factor 							that adjusts the safety stock required for the specified service level. 							With the service level selected at 50%, the safety stock is zero (that 							is, not required). The factor reaches 1.0 with the service level 							approximately 84%, which is the default value for the service level on 							the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form. To maintain a 							higher service level, you will need a safety stock that exceeds the 							calculated quantity. For an example of the calculation of the replenishment parameters for 				the moving average method, see  An Example of Replenishment Parameter Calculation. The 					 Maximum Stock  is set equal to  Reorder 					Point ; if needed, you can manually increase the value of 					 Maximum Stock . Setting Up Parameter Calculation You specify the forecast method and its parameters for each item class by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes (IN201000) form, and then the settings are used as 				default values for items of the class. You can select values that differ from the 				default ones for particular items of the class by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form. Moreover, if the  Multiple 					Warehouses  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features 				(CS100000) form, you can adjust the replenishment settings for each warehouse in 				which the items are stocked.  Splitting Parameters by Subitems If subitems are used in your system, you can use demand forecasting to calculate replenishment 				parameters for specific subitems of the items if having enough stock for these 				subitems is important to your business. For such items, on the 					 Replenishment Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, specify the initial replenishment 				parameters for each of the subitems used. After that, the system will calculate 				parameters for each listed subitem by using the forecasted daily demand (daily 				sales) for the specific subitem. All subitems of the item should be listed in the  Subitem Replenishment 					Parameters  table. If specific subitems do not require replenishment, 				specify zero values as their parameters. Updating Replenishment Parameters by Using Forecast-based Values You use the following  Acumatica ERP forms to update replenishment parameters and then prepare the replenishment:  ([~/?ScreenId=IN508500|IN508500]) Calculate Replenishment Parameters (IN508500): You use this form to compute the average 					daily sales and average lead time, and then to calculate the following 					parameters used in automated replenishment:  Max.

The on-hand quantities of items at warehouses are automatically updated only after the documents that record inventory transactions are released and posted. On-hand quantities usually differ from actually available quantities because documents can be processed later than actual operations with items have been performed: certain quantities of items can be booked on on-hold sales orders, picked for shipping but not shipped, returned from customers before returns are created, received from vendors with receipts not yet released. {br}

 Acumatica ERP gives you real-time visibility into available inventory, thus improving customer service. You can configure the way availability data is calculated in accordance with your company&rsquo;s policies. You define the availability calculation rules on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form. For each item class, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) form, you need to specify the particular calculation rule that defines the availability calculation options for this item class.{br}{TOC}
==Types of Quantities Calculated==
The available quantities of items are calculated at the location level. Some warehouse locations may hold some quantities of damaged or returned items, and those quantities generally cannot be used for sale and should not be included in the quantities available. ((({S:Hint}If the ''Multiple Warehouse Locations'' feature is disabled in your system, all the quantities available for a single default location of each warehouse are included in the availability data. For more information, see [HelpRoot_InvMgmt\IN__con_Warehouse_Locations|Warehouse Locations].
)))
For each item, the quantities summarized below are maintained in the system and available for viewing on any form where you select a stock item for adding to the document. 
{| class="checklist" | width="100%"

!width="20%" ! Element
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| '''Quantity On Hand'''
| 
This is the on-hand quantity is the quantity of items (expressed in the base unit of measure) that are physically in stock and immediately available. The on-hand quantity of items is affected only by released documents.{br}

If the '''Allow Negative Quantity''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] form, Acumatica ERP allows a negative on-hand quantity for items of the class. Warnings are issued on transactions that will result in negative inventory quantities. A location-level negative quantity can occur due to errors on inventory documents—incorrect quantities specified or wrong locations—or delayed release of receipt or transfer documents confirming the actual arrival of goods. Physical inventory can be undertaken for items with negative on-hand quantities.
|- 
| '''Quantity Not Available'''
| 
For each location in a warehouse, you can specify whether quantities at the location will be included in the quantity available. For example, items should not be included in quantities available for locations dedicated to items that are consigned, damaged, returned, or in need of repair.{br}

 If the '''Include in Qty. Available''' option is selected for the location on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form, the quantities available at the location will be added to the quantity available; if the option is not selected, those quantities will be added to the quantity not available. As a result, for each warehouse, the total quantities available and unavailable are calculated as the sum of respective quantities for all warehouse locations.
|- 
| '''Total Addition and Total Deduction'''
| 
The [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) inquiry form shows '''Total Addition''' and '''Total Deduction''', which have values calculated based on unreleased documents with various statuses.{br}

'''Total Addition''' is the quantity of base units of the inventory item on unreleased purchase orders, receipts, and incoming transfers. For each item class, you can specify which of the listed quantities should be included in this value for items of the class. See the '''Options Affecting Available Quantities''' section below for the entire list of availability options. {br}

'''Total Deduction''' is the quantity of base units of the inventory item on unreleased sales orders, inventory issues, shipments, transfers, and kit assembly documents, plus the non-available quantity.{br}

For each item class, you can specify which of the listed quantities should be included in the total deduction quantity for items of the class in accordance with policies established in your organization.
|- 
| '''Quantity Available'''
| 
 For each item, the quantity available is calculated as {{Quantity on Hand + Total Addition - Total Deduction}}.{br}

 This value is calculated in accordance with the options selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_10_00|Item Classes] form for the item class. See the '''Options Affecting Available Quantities''' section below for the entire list of availability options.
|- 
| '''Quantity Available for Shipping'''
|  This quantity is calculated by the system as the on-hand quantity with quantities on issues, quantities shipped, and quantities allocated deducted. This calculation is not affected by any options selected by users.
|}[anchor|#1]
==Options Affecting Available Quantities==
For each item class, you can select an availability calculation rule to define how you want the system to calculate the available quantities for items of the class. Each availability calculation rule, which you create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form, defines the options listed below.

As a result, for each warehouse, the total quantities 									available and unavailable are calculated as the sum of 									respective quantities for all warehouse locations. Total Addition and Total Deduction The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) Inventory Allocation Details (IN402000) 									inquiry form shows  Total Addition  and  Total 										Deduction , which have values calculated based on 									unreleased documents with various statuses. Total Addition  is the quantity of base units of the 									inventory item on unreleased purchase orders, receipts, and 									incoming transfers. For each item class, you can specify which 									of the listed quantities should be included in this value for 									items of the class. See the  Options Affecting Available 										Quantities  section below for the entire list of 									availability options.  Total Deduction  is the quantity of base units of the 									inventory item on unreleased sales orders, inventory issues, 									shipments, transfers, and kit assembly documents, plus the 									non-available quantity. For each item class, you can specify which of the listed 									quantities should be included in the total deduction quantity 									for items of the class in accordance with policies established 									in your organization. Quantity Available  For each item, the quantity available is calculated as 										 Quantity on Hand + Total Addition - Total 										Deduction .  This value is calculated in accordance with the options selected 									on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201000|IN201000]) Item Classes form for the item class. 									See the  Options Affecting Available Quantities  section 									below for the entire list of availability options. Quantity Available for Shipping  This quantity is calculated by the system as the on-hand 								quantity with quantities on issues, quantities shipped, and 								quantities allocated deducted. This calculation is not affected by 								any options selected by users. Options Affecting Available Quantities For each item class, you can select an availability calculation rule to define how 				you want the system to calculate the available quantities for items of the class. 				Each availability calculation rule, which you create on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) Availability Calculation Rules (IN201500) form, defines the options listed below. 				Documents with the  Released  and  Posted  statuses do not affect 				calculation of these quantities.

Suppose that on March 1, ABC company first purchased a new gadget for bikers (the ''New Gadget'' stock item) and sold it to a local sporting goods store, Best Sports. Best Sports decided to order 200 units during April and May. {br}

The ABC company&rsquo;s purchasing manager, who is responsible for sales of the ''New Gadget'' item, decided to use the following default replenishment parameters during these three months of sales:[anchor|#ul_jkb_m4v_ft]
*'''Safety Stock''': 20
*'''Reorder Point''': 50
*'''Max Quantity:''' 200

These parameters were specified for the ''New Gadget'' stock item on the '''Replenishment Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. {br}

Before extending the sales to other customers, the purchasing manager has decided to collect the relevant sales data during the first three months and then calculate the replenishment parameters based on this data using the following settings:[anchor|#ul_p4w_qtd_ht]
*'''Forecast Type''': ''Month''
