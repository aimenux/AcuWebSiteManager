[anchor|#_e5a1a566-0cb3-492b-967f-b63839ab6319]
==Personalization of the Workspace List in the Main Menu==
In the modern user interface, the links to forms are organized in workspaces, each of which corresponds to a functional area in the system. The main menu displays menu items corresponding to these workspaces (such as '''Orders'''); you can click any menu item.{br}

You can configure the list of workspaces displayed on the main menu panel by pinning and unpinning workspaces. You can pin to the panel only the workspaces that you use in your work frequently. Other workspaces you can access that are unpinned from the panel are hidden under '''More Items'''. You can pin and unpin the main menu items any time you need to (for example, when your work responsibilities change).{br}

For the steps you perform to pin and unpin a workspace on the main menu panel, see [HelpRoot_Portal\SP__how_Pin_Unpin_Workspaces|To Pin and Unpin a Workspace on the Main Menu Panel].[anchor|#_c51a9b52-0101-4695-8864-d53a2d175fc1]
==Personalization of Quick Menu of a Workspace==
When you click a menu item in the main menu, the system opens the quick menu of the workspace that corresponds to the menu item. You can use this menu to quickly access the forms that you use during your work. You can configure the list of forms in the quick menu for each workspace. We recommend that you display on the quick menu only forms that you use frequently. By clicking the workspace header, you can view the links to all forms of the workspace to which you have access.{br}

For a description of how to configure links to forms in the quick menu, see [HelpRoot_Portal\SP__how_Configure_Quick_Menu|To Configure the Quick Menu Items].[anchor|#_973a0a9b-9c6e-4ec8-b9f8-5bf44e6542a3]
==Changes to the Location and Size of the Main Menu==
By default, the main menu is located on the left side of the screen and is displayed in its maximum size. If you need more space in the working area of the screen (for example, to work with forms more conveniently), you can change the location and size of the main menu panel as follows:[anchor|#_447afe57-f40c-4b1d-9050-6bc0df79b0de]
*Collapse the menu panel so that only the icons of menu items are displayed by clicking ([image:Portal/Images/Main_Menu_Collapse_to_Left_Button.png|15px]) in the bottom right corner of the main menu panel.
*Collapse the menu panel to a button in the top left corner of the screen by clicking ([image:Portal/Images/Main_Menu_Dots.png|15px]) in the bottom left corner of the main menu panel and selecting '''Collapse to Top'''.
*Display only icons on the '''Menu''' button and in titles of the main menu items. To do this, you click '''Menu''' and then click ([image:Portal/Images/Main_Menu_Collapse_to_Left_Button.png|15px]) in the bottom right corner of the main menu panel.

A contract represents an agreement between a vendor (the provider of a service) and a customer (the consumer of this service)—and possibly a partner (which might be involved as a reseller). {br}

Contracts consist of different combinations of terms and services geared toward the particular needs and capabilities of the organizations involved. For example, a contract may specify that your company will be provided certain services—such as cable TV service, Internet access, or web account hosting—from a vendor during a specified period of time. Other contracts may contain service agreements to maintain and repair a product during the warranty period of the manufacturer or a particular time period. Service contracts often include a number of cases (often called ''tickets'') that may be solved during a warranty period. A case includes the efforts, such as the work time spent on problem resolution and the related phone calls and emails, to resolve a particular issue.{br}

You can view the contracts associated with your company account and the accounts of your partners. For each contract you can check the contract details—including the setup and expiration dates of the contract, the grace period, and the services in the contract—as described in [HelpRoot_Portal\SP__How_Viewing_Contracts|To View Contract Details].

''Cases'' (also known as ''tickets'') are used to record your requests, problems, complaints, and other inquiries. By using the case management in Self-Service Portal, you can submit new cases, change the case priority, enter additional information, get updates on the case status by email, check the case yourself for updates, and view responses to the case.
==Case Processing==
Typically, each case goes through stages; the status of a case reflects the stage it is in, as described in the following table.[anchor|#table_bjx_3vy_rk]
===Case Processing===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="33%" ! Case Status
!width="66%" ! Stage
|- 
| '''New'''
| You submit a new case.
|- 
| '''Open'''
| We work on your case.
|- 
| '''Pending Customer'''
| We await your response.
|- 
| '''Closed'''
| We have resolved and closed your case.
|}
When the case is updated, you get an email notification. Also, you can monitor the case by using the [HelpRoot_Portal\SP_20_40_00|Open Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=SP204000|SP204000]) form.
==New Case==
When you submit a new case, you enter the following information:[anchor|#ul_w31_mqy_rk]
*The case class that defines the default case settings, such as the contract and case attributes.
*The contract within which the case is processed. For more information about contracts, see [HelpRoot_Portal\SP__con_Contracts|Contracts Overview].
*The case priority, which defines the order of case processing.
*The case attributes, which depend on the case class.
*The subject and the description of your case. Supply as much relevant information as possible, so that we will be better able to help you.
*Any relevant files that you attach to the case.
*Any additional notes you provide.

For the detailed procedure, refer to [HelpRoot_Portal\SP__How_Entering_Cases|To Enter a New Case]. 
==Case Handling==
All cases are processed in the order of their priority. When we start working on the case, we change the case status from '''New''' to '''Open'''.{br}

If we change the case status to '''Pending Customer''', this means that we need your input. For example, we may need you to verify that we have achieved the desired result, or we may need additional information. Check the case for details.{br}

You can monitor the case status, as described in [HelpRoot_Portal\SP__How_Checking_Case_Details|To View and Edit Case Details].{br}

After the case is resolved, you close the case, as described in [HelpRoot_Portal\SP__How_Close_case|To Close a Case].
==Case Closing==
When you close the case, the case status is left as '''Open''' with the reason ''Pending Closure'' because we might need to add information to the case before closing it.{br}

When we finish working on the case, we set the case status to '''Closed'''. Depending on the request, the case can be closed with one of the following reasons:[anchor|#ul_vym_5gt_rk]
*''Resolved'': You have approved our decision or reply (depending on the initial request). 
*''Duplicate'': A similar case exists.
*''Canceled'': The case has been canceled by the owner.
*''Rejected'': We can&rsquo;t process the case for other reasons—for example, because a third-party product is involved.
*''Abandoned'': We were unable to resolve the issue because of a lack of response or requested information from the initial owner.

You can view the details of closed cases, as described in [HelpRoot_Portal\SP__How_Tracking_closed_cases|To Track Closed Cases].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Case Management Cases  (also known as  tickets ) are used to record your requests,                 problems, complaints, and other inquiries. By using the case management in  Self-Service Portal, you can submit new cases, change the case priority, enter additional                 information, get updates on the case status by email, check the case yourself for                 updates, and view responses to the case. Case Processing Typically, each case goes through stages; the status of a case reflects the stage it                 is in, as described in the following table. Case Processing Case Status Stage New You submit a new case. Open We work on your case. Pending Customer We await your response. Closed We have resolved and closed your case. When the case is updated, you get an email notification. Also, you can monitor the                 case by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SP204000|SP204000]) Open Cases (SP204000) form. New Case When you submit a new case, you enter the following information: The case class that defines the default case settings, such as the contract and                     case attributes. The contract within which the case is processed. For more information about                     contracts, see  Contracts Overview. The case priority, which defines the order of case processing. The case attributes, which depend on the case class. The subject and the description of your case. Supply as much relevant                     information as possible, so that we will be better able to help you. Any relevant files that you attach to the case. Any additional notes you provide. For the detailed procedure, refer to  To Enter a New Case.  Case Handling All cases are processed in the order of their priority. When we start working on the                 case, we change the case status from  New  to                      Open . If we change the case status to  Pending Customer , this means                 that we need your input. For example, we may need you to verify that we have                 achieved the desired result, or we may need additional information. Check the case                 for details. You can monitor the case status, as described in  To View and Edit Case Details. After the case is resolved, you close the case, as described in  To Close a Case. Case Closing When you close the case, the case status is left as  Open  with the reason                      Pending Closure  because we might need to add information to the case                 before closing it. When we finish working on the case, we set the case status to                      Closed . Depending on the request, the case can be closed                 with one of the following reasons: Resolved : You have approved our decision or reply (depending on the                     initial request).  Duplicate : A similar case exists. Canceled : The case has been canceled by the owner. Rejected : We can't process the case for other reasons—for example,                     because a third-party product is involved. Abandoned : We were unable to resolve the issue because of a lack of                     response or requested information from the initial owner. You can view the details of closed cases, as described in  To Track Closed Cases. ]]></column>

You can browse the Self-Service Portal catalog, which contains the list of available products and services. In this topic, you will find information about the catalog.
==Item Availability==
The catalog provides information about the available quantities of the products in different warehouses.

Searching on Self-Service Portal gives you the ability to quickly open a form (or a record on a form), find a file, or find a help topic. This topic contains information on performing searches in the modern user interface of Self-Service Portal.{br}{TOC}
==Search Form==
To begin a search, you type a text string in the '''Search''' box. The system opens the Search form in the working area, on top of the page (such as a dashboard or a form) that was opened when you started your search. The form is shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_fd80c30e-fd23-4ab4-b4b2-bbf3e77dce35][anchor|#_4fba661a-862a-4d70-a27f-fc090c6dab12][image:Portal/Images/SP_UIG_New_UI_Search_Results.png|popup|Search form|450px][anchor|#_dfcac0ff-0aeb-4371-accb-a10189e67933]
#Search filter tabs
#Search results

You can look through the search results on the Search form and go back to the page you had opened before you performed the search. For example, you can start to enter data on some Self-Service Portal form, search for some information, and then go back to the form and continue to enter data because your previous changes have been preserved.
==Search Filter Tabs==
By default, the search in Self-Service Portal is performed in form titles. You can switch to one of the search filter tabs to change the scope of the search. The following tabs are available:[anchor|#ul_yx2_jsg_g3]
*'''Menu Items''': On this tab, you can scan for specific forms by name or ID.
*'''Transactions and Profiles''': On this tab, you can look for specific system records, such as customers, vendors, prospects, employee accounts, and notes attached to records.
*'''Help and Support''': This tab lists search results in all guides and help topics. When you click a link to a Help topic, the topic is opened in a separate tab of a browser. If you want to open the Help topic over the working area, you should press Ctrl and click the link.
*'''Files''': On this tab, you can view files attached to system records.

When you type a text string in the '''Search''' box and switch between the search filter tabs, your text string is preserved, and search results are automatically displayed for this text string.
==Search Results==
In Self-Service Portal, an intelligent search is implemented. The system performs a flexible search, considering all possible forms of the text string that you have entered in the '''Search''' box, and then lists the search results from the most relevant to the least relevant.{br}

The system narrows the search results based on the access rights of the user who performs the search. If you don&rsquo;t have permissive access rights to particular data (such as contracts), these objects do not appear in the search results, even though they match the search criteria. Your access rights to file attachments are determined by your rights to the entities to which the files are attached.
==Search Tips==
Keep the following tips in mind when you use the search capabilities on Self-Service Portal:[anchor|#ul_lmf_hn3_zq]
*To search for all possible forms of a particular word or phrase, you type it as is without any additional characters. For example, if you type ''invoice'' in the '''Search''' box, the system displays all strings that contain ''invoice'', ''invoices'', and ''invoiced''.
*To search for an exact match of a particular word or phrase, you enclose it in quotation marks. For example, if you type ''“Western Star Trucks”'' in the '''Search''' box, the system returns only the customer with this exact name.
*To search for a particular string everywhere in the system (in form titles, help topics, system entities, and files), you type the string in the '''Search''' box and then switch to each of the filtering tabs.

In Self-Service Portal, you can adjust any table to meet your information needs. If some columns in the table are unimportant or not useful to you, you can hide them temporarily or permanently. For the remaining columns in the table, you can automatically adjust column width so that all columns fit on the screen, or you can manually adjust column widths. These changes affect only your user account and are not visible to other users.((({S:Hint}When you make any changes, the table will display them immediately. If you want to see these changes when you access the form in the future, save the layout of the table.
)))
==Hiding or Displaying Columns in Tables==
You use the Column Selection button, shown in the screenshot below, to change the columns to be displayed and to save the layout.[anchor|#image_ibl_d5d_33][image:Portal/Images/details_table_layout.png|popup|Changing the table layout|180px][anchor|#ul_wk5_z4f_s3]
*Column Selection button

To hide or display a column in a table on a form, do the following: 
#In the table, click the Column Selection button (the leftmost icon on the table heading) to open the list of columns available for the table. Note that columns that are displayed in the table are preceded by checkmarks, while columns that are not displayed have no checkmarks.
#Click each column name you want to display or hide; this adds or removes the checkmark.
#Optional: When only the columns you want to display are preceded by checkmarks, click '''Save Layout''' to save the changes.

==Adjusting Column Widths==
If not all columns fit on the screen and you must scroll the form to the right to view some of them, you can adjust the column width so that you can view all columns on the screen without scrolling. You might not see some column headers in their entirety, if their full text cannot be shown in the reduced column width, but making this adjustment will display all the columns.{br}

 To adjust the column width automatically, do the following:
#On the table toolbar, click '''Fit to Screen'''. The widths of the columns will be reduced proportionally so that the whole table will fit the screen.
#Optional: To save the changes, click the Column Selection button, and then click '''Save Layout'''.
[anchor|#image_z3z_mpd_33][image:Portal/Images/Details_table_Adjusting.png|popup|Adjusting column widths manually|250px]
To change the width of certain columns manually, do the following:[anchor|#ol_vxp_jtc_m3]
#Move the pointer over the column split line. When the pointer becomes a double-headed arrow, as shown in the screenshot above, drag the pointer to move the line.
#Repeat this step for each column split line you want to move.
#Optional: To save the changes, click the Column Selection button, and then click '''Save Layout'''.

==Changing the Order of Columns==
At times, you might want to change the order of columns so that the information is grouped to better fit your work and preferences.[anchor|#image_rcb_mqd_33][image:Portal/Images/Details_table_Move.png|popup|Moving a column to another position in the table|220px]
To move columns to other positions in the table, do the following:
#In the table header, drag the column heading to the desired position. Note the red arrows (see the screenshot above) that indicate the exact position where you can drop the column between two other columns. 
#Repeat this step for each column you want to move.
#Optional: To save the changes, click the Column Selection button, and then click '''Save Layout'''.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Changing Table Layout In  Self-Service Portal, you can adjust any table to meet your information needs. If some columns in the                 table are unimportant or not useful to you, you can hide them temporarily or                 permanently. For the remaining columns in the table, you can automatically adjust                 column width so that all columns fit on the screen, or you can manually adjust                 column widths. These changes affect only your user account and are not visible to                 other users. When you make any changes, the table will display them immediately. If you want to                 see these changes when you access the form in the future, save the layout of the                 table. Hiding or Displaying Columns in Tables You use the Column Selection button, shown in the screenshot below, to change the                 columns to be displayed and to save the layout. Changing the table layout Column Selection button To hide or display a column in a table on a form, do the following:  In the table, click the Column Selection button (the leftmost icon on the table                     heading) to open the list of columns available for the table. Note that columns                     that are displayed in the table are preceded by checkmarks, while columns that                     are not displayed have no checkmarks. Click each column name you want to display or hide; this adds or removes the                     checkmark. Optional: When only the columns you want to display are preceded by checkmarks,                     click  Save Layout  to save the changes. Adjusting Column Widths If not all columns fit on the screen and you must scroll the form to the right to                 view some of them, you can adjust the column width so that you can view all columns                 on the screen without scrolling. You might not see some column headers in their                 entirety, if their full text cannot be shown in the reduced column width, but making                 this adjustment will display all the columns.  To adjust the column width automatically, do the following: On the table toolbar, click  Fit to Screen . The widths of                     the columns will be reduced proportionally so that the whole table will fit the                     screen. Optional: To save the changes, click the Column Selection button, and then click                          Save Layout . Adjusting column widths manually To change the width of certain columns manually, do the following: Move the pointer over the column split line. When the pointer becomes a                     double-headed arrow, as shown in the screenshot above, drag the pointer to move                     the line. Repeat this step for each column split line you want to move. Optional: To save the changes, click the Column Selection button, and then click                          Save Layout .

Whether you enter a new data or view the inquiry results, you may need to perform specific operations with tables; typical operations are discussed below.{br}

For instructions on adjusting table layout, see [HelpRoot_Portal\SP_Changing_the_Details_Table_Layout|Changing Table Layout].
==Switching between Form View and Grid View==
On data entry forms, tables can be presented in grid view or form view, as shown in the screenshots below:[anchor|#ul_ttq_zhs_yk]
*'''Grid view'''. A standard tabular view, with all details arranged in a table and each row representing one detail or document line.[anchor|#image_aqv_mxd_33][image:Portal/Images/Details_table_Grid_view.png|popup|Table grid view|300px]
*'''Form view'''. A set of elements intended for only one detail or document line; you use the navigation buttons (in the lower left corner of the form) to move from one detail to another.[anchor|#image_lkw_4xd_33][image:Portal/Images/Details_table_Form_view.png|popup|Table form view|300px]

To switch between these two views, you click '''Switch Between Grid and Form''' on the table toolbar.
==Adding a Row to the Table==
To add a row to a table, you do one of the following: [anchor|#ul_xlm_5hs_yk]
*On the table toolbar (in any view), click '''Add Row'''.
*In the grid view, click anywhere in the table below the existing table rows.
*In the form view, click '''Next'''.

 The system appends a new row to the table, and you can fill out all required boxes (and any optional ones) for a new detail or object. You can click in any box to display its controls. Some boxes have selectors and some have input validation masks; for some boxes, you can type the value directly. For more information about data input, see [HelpRoot_Portal\SP_Form_Fields|Form Elements]. 
==Deleting a Row from the Table==
If you need to delete a row from a table, do the following: [anchor|#ol_dmm_5hs_yk]
#Make sure the object specified in the row is not used in the system. For example, if it is a ledger, no transactions should be posted to it; if it is a class, it should have no members; and if it is a document detail line, the document should not be released.
#In the table, click the row to select it.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Delete'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

==Selecting Objects in the Table==
Some forms have a Select column (with a check box as a header) that you can use as follows to select objects from the table:[anchor|#ul_tds_xn4_5k]
*To select particular objects, click the check box in the Select column for each object.
*To select all objects displayed on the current page of the table, click the Select check box in the column header.

==Filtering and Sorting==
You might find it helpful to narrow and rearrange the range of displayed objects before selecting particular ones. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Portal\SP_Filters|Filters].
==Attaching Files to the Table Rows==
You can attach a file or multiple files, such as a scanned image of the original document or its electronic version, to each row. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Portal\SP_Attaching_Notes_to_Record_Details|Attaching Notes to Record Details].
==Attaching Notes to the Table Rows==
You can attach a note to each row. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Portal\SP_Attaching_Notes_to_Record_Details|Attaching Notes to Record Details].]]></column>

Many users, having worked with Microsoft Excel for years, prefer to perform detailed financial analysis using an Excel spreadsheet on their desktop. For such users, Self-Service Portal broadly supports integration with Microsoft Excel.((({S:Hint} Self-Service Portal uses the spreadsheet format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, so if you use an earlier version of Microsoft Office, you should install the appropriate plug-in.
)))[anchor|#image_af2_2yb_h3][image:Portal/Images/Expot_to_Excel.png|popup|Export to Microsoft Excel|250px]
==To Export Data to Microsoft Excel==[anchor|#_xv4_ptq_mg]
#Open the form whose data you want to export.
#In the summary or selection area (if any), use the form elements or navigation buttons to select the data displayed in the table.
#Optional: Further select the data for export by filtering. For more information on using filters, see [HelpRoot_Portal\SP_Filters|Filters].
#On the table toolbar, click '''Export to Excel''' ([image:Portal/Images/form_toolbar_buttons_Excel.png|Export to Microsoft Excel|12px]).
#Follow the necessary steps, depending on your browser and settings, to download the Excel file with the exported data.

==Updating Excel Files==
If you exported the data from an inquiry form to an Excel file, you can update your Excel file from the Self-Service Portal database. You can retrieve the data from the web and update the file contents without again exporting data from the system and repeating all post-export configuration steps.{br}

To update an Excel file, do the following:[anchor|#ol_i3h_4cc_mk]
#Open the file.
#When you&rsquo;re prompted, enable editing and enable external data connections so that Excel can update the file.
#Refresh the data. Do the following:
#*In Microsoft Excel 2007, 2010, and 2013: On the '''Data''' tab, in the '''Connections''' group, click '''Refresh All'''.
#*In Microsoft Excel 2003: On the '''External Data''' toolbar, click '''Refresh All'''.
#:When you are prompted to authenticate yourself, enter your Self-Service Portal user name and password.

The contents of the file are updated with the filtering criteria you specified on the inquiry form before exporting the data. If the filtering criteria includes the default values, such values will be updated as well. For example, if the filtering criteria includes the current financial period, when the period is changed in the system, it will be automatically updated in the file.{br}

Additionally, you can aggregate data from several forms to one Excel workbook and use the file as you want—for example, as a source for summarizing and analyzing data. Do the following:[anchor|#ol_bkd_n1x_lk]
#Export data from the form you want to use.
#Copy the sheets from the exported files to one Excel workbook and save the resulting file.

Once you have performed these steps, when you refresh data in Excel, the data on all spreadsheets will be updated simultaneously.

#On the form toolbar, click '''Save'''.

To read the note, open the form, select the record, select the record detail with the note attached, and click Note Attached.
==Managing Attached Files==
With Self-Service Portal, you can easily manage and track files and images attached to Self-Service Portal records and record details for various purposes.

To create a filter, you create conditions for the form the filter will be applied to. A filter may contain just one condition, or it may contain multiple simple condition lines, each on its own row of the table, that you combine into one logical expression by using brackets and logical operators.[anchor|#_sjk_zyq_mg]
===Filter Table Columns===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Column
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| Select
| 
An unlabeled check box that you use to select conditions you want to be active. {br}

As you specify a condition, it becomes active, with the Select check box automatically selected. To quickly modify the filter, you can clear check boxes for some of the conditions to exclude them from the filter. This check box is not, however, available for reports.
|- 
| '''Brackets'''
| A set of opening brackets used to group logical conditions. You can use brackets to form filters with multiple lines.
|- 
| '''Property'''
| Required. The property, which you select from a list that includes the properties associated with the particular table the filter will be applied to.
|- 
| '''Condition'''
| Required. The logical operation that applies to the value of the selected property, such as ''Equals'', ''Does Not Equal'', ''Is Greater Than'', ''Is Less Than or Equal To'', ''Contains'', ''Starts With'', ''Does Not Contain'', ''Is Between'', ''Is Null'', or ''Is Not Null''.
|- 
| '''Value'''
| 
The value for the logical condition used to filter the data. You can either type a value or select one from the list of possible values for the property.
|- 
| '''Second Value'''
| 
The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical condition requires a second value. (For example, the ''Is Between'' logical condition requires a second value.)
|- 
| '''Brackets'''
| 
A set of closing brackets to group logical conditions. You use brackets to form filters with multiple condition lines.
|- 
| '''Operator'''
| 
The logical operator (''And'' or ''Or'') to be used between groups of logical conditions. You select this operator to join the current condition with the following.
|}
To specify filter conditions, do the following:[anchor|#ol_cjz_54n_n3]
#In the filter conditions table, add a new row.
#In the table row, specify the condition.
#Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for each additional condition.
#Click the Select check boxes in the table rows for the active conditions.

==Filter Example==
For example, if you want to filter transactions with batch numbers greater than 3800 that were entered in March 2006, you specify the condition rows as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#image_eyw_cws_n3][image:Portal/Images/Filter_example.png|popup|440px]

Advanced filters, available on processing forms, are created once and can be reused at a later date. Those filters are form-specific—meaning that a reusable filter can be applied to one specific form.{br}

You can create and manage advanced filters by using the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box, which you invoke directly from the processing or inquiry form for which the filter is intended.{br}

The filters section of the table toolbar is used to apply and cancel filtering, and to create, delete, and manage your advanced filters for the form. You can see the available filters listed in the '''Select Filter''' box of the table toolbar. This list includes the system advanced filters, the advanced filters you created, and the advanced filters other users have created and shared. {br}

If a filter has been applied to the table, you can see the name of this filter in the '''Select Filter''' box on the table toolbar. If the default filter for this form is specified, the name of this filter is displayed in the '''Select Filter''' box when you open that form.{br}

For more information about the filters section of the table toolbar, see [HelpRoot_Portal\SP_Details_Toolbar|Table Toolbar Overview].[anchor|#section_e4x_5k5_3k]
==Categories of Advanced Filters==
Reusable filters have categories that define the use of the filter. For example, if you define a filter as default, this filter is automatically applied to the form when this form is opened.[anchor|#table_cll_mdv_j3]
===Filter Categories===
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Check Box
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| '''Default'''

|- 
| '''Shortcut'''
| Indicates that the form with this particular filter applied will be available if you click the link on the dashboard, if the form was added to a dashboard. 
|- 
| '''Shared'''
| Indicates that the filter will be shared with other users. If it is checked, the filter is shared, no matter who created it. 
|}
==Managing Filters in Forms==
You can manage filters that can be applied to the table of the particular form by using the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box of that form.[anchor|#ul_cx4_fky_k3]{br}

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Advanced Filters Advanced filters, available on processing forms, are created once and can be reused at a         later date. Those filters are form-specific—meaning that a reusable filter can be applied to         one specific form. You can create and manage advanced filters by using the  Filter           Settings  dialog box, which you invoke directly from the processing or inquiry         form for which the filter is intended. The filters section of the table toolbar is used to apply and cancel filtering, and to         create, delete, and manage your advanced filters for the form. You can see the available         filters listed in the  Select Filter  box of the table toolbar. This         list includes the system advanced filters, the advanced filters you created, and the         advanced filters other users have created and shared.  If a filter has been applied to the table, you can see the name of this filter in the            Select Filter  box on the table toolbar. If the default filter for         this form is specified, the name of this filter is displayed in the  Select           Filter  box when you open that form. For more information about the filters section of the table toolbar, see  Table Toolbar Overview. Categories of Advanced Filters Reusable filters have categories that define the use of the filter. For example, if you         define a filter as default, this filter is automatically applied to the form when this form         is opened. Filter Categories Check Box Description Default Indicates that this is the default filter for the selected form. Shortcut Indicates that the form with this particular filter applied will be available                 if you click the link on the dashboard, if the form was added to a dashboard.                Shared Indicates that the filter will be shared with other users. If it is checked,                 the filter is shared, no matter who created it.  Managing Filters in Forms You can manage filters that can be applied to the table of the particular form by using the            Filter Settings  dialog box of that form. To open the  Filter Settings  dialog box, do the         following:  Open the form. On the table toolbar, click  Add Filter .
