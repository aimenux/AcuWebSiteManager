			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, you can personalize your account, workspace, document processing, and data representation in ways to make using the system easier. You can specify your preferences for email signature, and dashboards. Other users will not be able to view your personal settings.{br}

 Acumatica ERP provides you with standard actions that you can use on many forms (such as exporting tables to Excel workbooks and attaching files to records) or even anywhere in the system (such as searching). {br}

In this topic, you will read about various system-wide actions and ways of personalizing Acumatica ERP to your needs.{br}{TOC}
==Access to Acumatica ERP==
To access the system, you identify yourself by typing your username and password when you sign in to the system. You can use your internal Acumatica ERP credentials, your domain credentials (if a system administrator of your organization has integrated Acumatica ERP with Active Directory), or your account credentials with an external identity provider, such as Google or Microsoft Account (if a system administrator of your organization has configured single sign-on with these providers).{br}

If you use Acumatica ERP credentials to access the system, your system administrator can allow you to change your password any time you want during your work with the system. If you forget your password or login, you can recover them if your system administrator has turned on this ability for you.{br}

Although it is a system administrator who initially fills in information about user accounts, you can change the parameters of your account without contacting the administrator. For example, you can specify or change your first and last name and your email address.{br}

You can sign in to different company branches (or even different companies) in different tabs of the same window or different windows of the same browser. After you finish working with the system, you should sign out to prevent unauthorized access to your account.{br}

For more information about access to Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__mng_Access|Accessing an Acumatica ERP Instance].
==Settings of Your Working Environment ==
 Acumatica ERP provides you with tools for personalizing your working environment to make it more convenient for you. You can configure the following parameters:[anchor|#_ec41eae0-fafa-4380-8281-5d1b7e404467]
*Time zone
*Locale settings (date, time, and number formats)
*Home page
*Favorite forms
For details about settings of your working environment, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__mng_Workspace|Managing Your Acumatica ERP Working Environment].
==Document Processing Settings==
In Acumatica ERP, you can set up certain parameters that affect your work with documents. If you have to sign PDF documents that you create in the system with a digital signature, you can use your personal certificate instead of the general certificate that is specified by your system administrator.{br}

If you send emails in Acumatica ERP, you may need to configure your signature, which you can do in your user profile.{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__mng_Personal_Document_Processing|Personalizing Document Processing].
==Personal Tasks and Events==
In the system, you can easily access tasks and events that were assigned to you. You can see the number of assigned tasks and events in the info area (for details, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Info_area|Info Area] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide) and open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_41_00|Events] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404100|EP404100]) form for more details. If a reminder is configured for a task or event, you will be notified about the coming task or event in advance. For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__mng_Tasks_Events|Managing Your Tasks and Events].
==Data Presentation==
 Acumatica ERP stores and displays large data loads, and you may want to make this data convenient for view and analysis. To solve this task, you can filter data in reports and tables, and save filters for later usage. You also can adjust table view—for example, widen or constrict column widths and change column order. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__mng_Personalize_Data_Representation|Personalizing the Presentation of Data ].
==Personal Dashboards==
Multiple dashboards can be created in Acumatica ERP by your system administrator or other colleagues who have appropriate rights. You can personalize these dashboards to view exactly the information you need if your system administrator allowed you to do so. For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__mng_Dashboards|Configuring Dashboards].
==Mobile Device Management==
If you are using the Acumatica mobile app, the information about the devices that allow push notifications from the app (within the settings of the particular mobile device) is stored in your Acumatica ERP user profile. The first time you sign in to the mobile app on a particular mobile device, the application sends details about your device to Acumatica ERP, and then the information is updated (if needed) with each subsequent sign-in. You can remove from the list of devices a device that you are no longer using or that you have lost. Also, you can control to which devices you allow the system to send push notifications.
==System-Wide Actions==
In Acumatica ERP, you can use standard actions that are available in multiple places of the system. If you need to, you can attach files (for example, scanned documents) and notes (for example, processing instructions for a document) to records. You can search for forms, help topics, or records if you want to quickly find these system entities.{br}

When you create new documents and objects in Acumatica ERP, you can fill in all document elements from scratch, copy and paste an existing document or object of the same type, or use a previously created template. The copy-and-paste options and templates make the creation process much easier for you and help you minimize input errors.{br}

When you work in Acumatica ERP, you may need to export data in formats that can be opened by external applications, such as Microsoft Excel. To solve this task, you can export data to Excel and CSV formats. The import operation from these formats is also supported. This support is useful, for example, when you have some data in Excel and want to load it in Acumatica ERP for further processing.{br}

If sometimes you need to transfer generic inquiries from one Acumatica ERP instance to another, you can use export and import of data in XML format.{br}

For more information about system-wide actions, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__mng_System_Wide_Actions|Using System-Wide Actions].
==User Interface==
Employees on different positions use different sets of forms in Acumatica ERP to perform their work tasks. You can configure the user interface so that forms and reports you use frequently are at hand. If your user role provides you with access to multiple functional areas (such as Payables, Receivables, and Sales Orders) but you use forms in particular areas more often than in other areas, you can configure workspaces in the main menu so that the system displays only frequently used workspaces there. Similarly, you can configure each workspace to which you have access. To the Quick Menu, you can add only forms that you use more often.{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__mng_Presonalize_User_Interface|Personalizing the Modern User Interface].
==Documents Approval==
Your organization can reduce the time required for document assignment and routing because the system provides automatic assignment for all the required approvals. In Acumatica ERP the process of document approval can be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form. Acumatica ERP provides a single form, [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]), that can be used as a starting point for all documents that require approval. {br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\CO__con_Centralized_Approvals|Approving Documents].]]></column>

Information about the financial documents processed in each organization is confidential, so system administrators who deploy and support Acumatica ERP in your organization restrict access to the system by creating user accounts or integrating Acumatica ERP with external identity providers.{br}

For the full list of system settings available to you, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__GS_Features|Overview of Your Personal Settings].{br}

In this topic, you will read about managing user account information, signing in and out of Acumatica ERP, recovering your credentials, and changing your password.{br}{TOC}
==Managing User Account Details==
As a user of Acumatica ERP, you have a separate user account that defines what forms you can access, what changes you can make, and what your personal settings are. Your user account contains the following:[anchor|#ul_x5r_31r_qy]
*A login (username), which is managed by your system administrator
*A password
*Additional information about you, which you can manage without contacting your system administrator

On the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form, you can manage the following personal information:[anchor|#ul_n3c_kmv_nk]
*Your first name and last name.
*Your phone number.
*Your password. For details, see [[#_f8b328b5-10ee-4321-bca7-4a60e468e53e|Changing the Password of Your Account].
*Your email account. For information about how to configure your email account, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\User_Profile_Email|To Configure Your Email Account].
*Your password recovery question and answer. For details, see [[#_0acb9780-70df-45f9-8143-fd5f9f326a59|Recovering Your User Credentials].
((({S:Hint}If your Acumatica ERP instance is integrated with Active Directory, for domain users, some of the settings listed above are unavailable; they are set on the domain level in Active Directory.
)))
To open the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] form, in the Info area (in the top right corner of the screen), click your username and select '''User Profile'''.
==Signing In and Signing Out==
When you want to work with Acumatica ERP, you need to sign in to the system—that is, to type your login and password so the system knows who you are and what access rights you have. Depending on how your system administrator has configured your account, it is one of the following:[anchor|#_19ea7d6b-e477-4c30-82d0-98638737f3e3]
* Acumatica ERP account: You use your login and password that the system administrator has created for you in Acumatica ERP to access the system.
*Domain account: If the system administrator has integrated Acumatica ERP with Microsoft Active Directory, you use your domain login and password (which you use to log in to your computer) to sign in to Acumatica ERP.
*Account of an external identity provider: If the system administrator has configured single sign-on with an external identity provider, such as Google or Microsoft Account, you use your credentials of this provider to sign in to Acumatica ERP. For details how to register your Google or Microsoft account, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SSO_register_external_account|To Activate Your Google or Microsoft Account].

You can sign in to different company branches (or even different companies) in different tabs of the same window or different windows of the same browser. When you stop working with Acumatica ERP, you should sign out to prevent unauthorized access.{br}

For the procedures that describe how to sign in to Acumatica ERP and sign out of the system, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\Login_and_Logout__how_Log_in|To Sign In and Sign Out].[anchor|#_f8b328b5-10ee-4321-bca7-4a60e468e53e]
==Changing the Password of Your Acumatica ERP Account==
Your system administrator can allow you to change the password of your Acumatica ERP account any time you want. The ability to change your own password is useful, for example, when you suspect that your account is being accessed without your consent. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\User_Profile_Password_Change|To Change Your Password].[anchor|#_0acb9780-70df-45f9-8143-fd5f9f326a59]
==Recovering Your User Credentials==
If you use Acumatica ERP credentials to sign in to the system, your system administrator can allow you to recover your password and login. The recovery mechanism sends emails to the email address that is specified in your account information. For details about how to recover your credentials, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\Login_and_Logout__Recover_password|To Recover a Forgotten Password or a User Name].{br}

On the [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM_20_30_10|User Profile] ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) form, you can specify a password recovery question, the answer to which you need to enter when you are recovering your password. With a password recovery question, you reduce a risk of hacking your user account. For a procedure, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Change_Password_Recovery_Question|To Specify Your Password Recovery Question].{br}

If you have forgetten your password from a domain account, you should contact your system administrator.{br}

If you have forgotten your password from an external identity account, you should use the password recovery tools of the external identity provider.

In this topic, you will read about managing user account information, signing in and                 out of  Acumatica ERP, recovering your credentials, and changing your password. Managing User Account Details As a user of  Acumatica ERP, you have a separate user account that defines what forms you can access, what                 changes you can make, and what your personal settings are. Your user account                 contains the following: A login (username), which is managed by your system administrator A password Additional information about you, which you can manage without contacting your                     system administrator On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile (SP203010) form, you can                 manage the following personal information: Your first name and last name. Your phone number. Your password. For details, see  Changing the Password of Your  Account Changing the Password of Your Account. Your email account. For information about how to configure your email account,                     see  To Configure Your Email Account. Your password recovery question and answer. For details, see  Recovering Your User Credentials Recovering Your User Credentials. If your  Acumatica ERP instance is integrated with Active Directory, for domain users, some of the                 settings listed above are unavailable; they are set on the domain level in Active                 Directory. To open the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile form, in the Info area (in                 the top right corner of the screen), click your username and select  User                     Profile . Signing In and Signing Out When you want to work with  Acumatica ERP, you need to sign in to the system—that is, to type your login and password so                 the system knows who you are and what access rights you have. Depending on how your                 system administrator has configured your account, it is one of the following:  Acumatica ERP account: You use your login and password that the system administrator                         has created for you in  Acumatica ERP to access the system. Domain account: If the system administrator has integrated  Acumatica ERP with Microsoft Active Directory, you use your domain login and password                         (which you use to log in to your computer) to sign in to  Acumatica ERP. Account of an external identity provider: If the system administrator has                         configured single sign-on with an external identity provider, such as Google                         or Microsoft Account, you use your credentials of this provider to sign in                         to  Acumatica ERP. For details how to register your Google or Microsoft account, see  To Activate Your Google or Microsoft Account. You can sign in to different company branches (or even different companies) in                 different tabs of the same window or different windows of the same browser. When you                 stop working with  Acumatica ERP, you should sign out to prevent unauthorized access. For the procedures that describe how to sign in to  Acumatica ERP and sign out of the system, see  To Sign In and Sign Out. Changing the Password of Your  Acumatica ERP Account Your system administrator can allow you to change the password of your  Acumatica ERP account any time you want. The ability to change your own password is useful, for                 example, when you suspect that your account is being accessed without your consent.                 For details, see  To Change Your Password. Recovering Your User Credentials If you use  Acumatica ERP credentials to sign in to the system, your system administrator can allow you to                 recover your password and login. The recovery mechanism sends emails to the email                 address that is specified in your account information. For details about how to                 recover your credentials, see  To Recover a Forgotten Password or a User Name. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM203010|SM203010]) User Profile (SM203010) form, you can                 specify a password recovery question, the answer to which you need to enter when you                 are recovering your password. With a password recovery question, you reduce a risk                 of hacking your user account. For a procedure, see  To Specify Your Password Recovery Question. If you have forgetten your password from a domain account, you should contact your                 system administrator. If you have forgotten your password from an external identity account, you should use                 the password recovery tools of the external identity provider.

To make your work more effective, Acumatica ERP provides you with tools that help you to organize your tasks and events, which you can create and manage in the system.{br}

In this topic, you will read about accessing your tasks and events, and adding reminders.{br}{TOC}
==Your Tasks and Events==
The '''My Tasks and Events''' menu, located in the info area (upper-right corner of the screen; see [HelpRoot_Interface\Info_area|Info Area] in the Interface Guide), offers you a quick way to access the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_41_00|Events] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404100|EP404100]) forms.((({S:Hint}The '''My Tasks and Events''' menu appears on the screen if the functionality is enabled for your Acumatica ERP instance by your system administrator. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\WebConfig__how_MyTasksAndEvents|To Turn On the My Tasks and Events Button] in the Acumatica ERP Installation Guide.
)))
The '''My Tasks and Events''' menu button displays the total number of active tasks and events assigned to the current user, with a value in parentheses that indicates the number of new tasks and events. The numbers of new tasks and events are also displayed separately in the '''Tasks''' and '''Events''' command names.{br}

The system updates the information displayed on the '''My Tasks and Events''' menu every 10 seconds, so you can view the most current information about your tasks and events. A new task or event created in the system causes the following values to increase:[anchor|#ul_y4b_ggx_f3]
*The total value (if you added the task or event)
*Both the total and new values (if the task or event was added by any other means)

For details about work with tasks, see [[#_0d9864a6-c8db-4c65-b40a-a8f55ddc5990|Keeping Track of Your Tasks]. For more information about events, see [[#_fdd8a378-d080-4924-a257-d8cdca1fba21|Keeping Track of Your Events].{br}

For an important task or event, you can configure a reminder. In this case, for affected users, the '''Reminder''' button in the info area will blink at the time you specify, and the '''Reminder''' dialog box will appear (for details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__ref_Reminder_Dialog_Box|Reminder Dialog Box]), informing them about all tasks and events that require their attention. For more information about reminders, see [[#_3a8c565c-8ca1-4068-8dc4-8dbb0f954fb4|Using Reminders].[anchor|#_0d9864a6-c8db-4c65-b40a-a8f55ddc5990]
==Keeping Track of Your Tasks==
The [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) form displays the list of tasks assigned to you. By using this form, you can view tasks, drill down to the details of a task, and complete or cancel a task.{br}

To open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] form, do the following:[anchor|#ul_gvx_b4y_m3]
*On the '''My Tasks and Events''' menu, click '''Tasks'''.

The [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] form displays the tasks you have created and all the tasks in your scope. For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\EP__con_Task_Management|Task Tracking Options].{br}

Depending on the default filter set for the form (if one has been set), you may see all active tasks or the most urgent ones. If a filter has been used, the filter name appears in the '''Select Filter''' box on the table toolbar (upper right). For more information about filters, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__mng_Personalize_Data_Representation|Personalizing the Presentation of Data ].{br}

You can click any task in the list to view or edit the details of the task. For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\EP__con_Task_Management|Task Management].[anchor|#_fdd8a378-d080-4924-a257-d8cdca1fba21]
==Keeping Track of Your Events==
An event is an activity with a specific starting time and duration. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_41_00|Events] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404100|EP404100]) form displays all events associated with your user name. By using this form, you can do the following:[anchor|#_289777d7-f1a2-4acc-a145-9527414368d2]
*View events
*Drill down to the details of an event
*Complete an event
*Cancel an event
*Export an event or your entire calendar with all events

To open the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_41_00|Events] form, do the following:[anchor|#ul_v5k_1ql_n3]
*On the '''My Tasks and Events''' menu, click '''Events'''.

Depending on the filter set for the form (if one has been set), you might see all active events or only specific ones. If a filter has been applied to the list of events, the '''Select Filter''' box on the table toolbar (upper right) displays the filter name.{br}

You can click any event in the list to view or edit the details of the event. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\EP__con_Notifications_About_Events|Notifications About Events].[anchor|#_3a8c565c-8ca1-4068-8dc4-8dbb0f954fb4]
==Using Reminders==
In Acumatica ERP, you can set reminders to alert yourself and other users about tasks and events that require attention or are overdue.[anchor|#_cf1acff2-a1c6-4c12-8a5f-812d28697473]((({S:Hint}Before you can start using reminders, you must ask your system administrator to enable the reminder functionality. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\Configuring_reminders|To Turn On Reminders] in the Acumatica ERP Installation Guide.
)))
You can set up reminders for a task or an event, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\Reminders__how_Setup|To Set Up Reminders for Tasks and Events].{br}

At the time you have specified, the '''Reminder''' dialog box for the activated task or event will appear on the Acumatica ERP page you are using. You can cause the reminder to snooze (disappear and then reappear at a later time) or dismiss the task or event.{br}

Additionally, you can view the &ldquo;snoozing&ldquo; tasks and events in the '''Reminders''' dialog box which you can open by clicking the Reminder ([anchor|#image_crv_3cg_ps][image:UserGuide/Images/Reminders_Button.png|12px]) button in the info area.{br}

With the task management capabilities of Acumatica ERP, you can keep personal to-do lists, configure reminders for all tasks or only the most important ones, track tasks assigned to you, create tasks, assign tasks to other users, and follow up on tasks assigned to others. These capabilities help you do the right things at the right time, so you can improve your performance and efficiency. 
==Tasks==
Each task has a ''creator'' and an ''assignee'': The task&rsquo;s creator is the employee who created the task, and its assignee is the employee to whom the task is assigned. (The creator and assignee may be the same employee.) A task should be assigned before it is saved. {br}

Tasks can be created as associated with no specific entity, or they can be created as associated with any of the following entities: leads, contacts, opportunities, business accounts, cases, employees, and projects. You can create such an association by using one of the following methods: [anchor|#ul_vvr_gf3_xp]
*Specifying a related entity by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_20|Task] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306020|CR306020]) form when you create a new task or adjust an existing one
*Creating a task by using the '''Activities''' tab on the corresponding data entry form. For instance, to create a task that will be associated with a certain case, you would use this tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_00|Cases] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306000|CR306000]) form.
{br}

When creating a task, the creator can configure a reminder for it and specify on what day before the due date the assignee should receive the reminder. On the specified date, the reminder will appear in the info area of the assignee&rsquo;s screen and will be blinking or highlighted in red until either of the users, the creator or the assignee, completes the task or changes its status.[anchor|#_dc9ef50a-a476-4656-9ce7-25c77573bf8e]((({S:Hint}Before you can start using reminders, you must ask your system administrator to enable the reminder functionality. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\Configuring_reminders|To Turn On Reminders] in the Acumatica ERP Installation Guide.
)))[anchor|#_b3f37502-4193-474e-9f21-d496e84ea2fc][anchor|#_399d3984-395b-4e87-8fdb-ddc152167d1c]
==Task Tracking Options==
You can view the total number of your tasks and events, including the new ones, in the info area at the top of any Acumatica ERP form. The '''Tasks''' link opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) form. By using this form, you can view the following tasks: [anchor|#ul_qzr_fj3_xp]
*Those you have created. If these tasks are assigned to other users, you might want to track them to see whether they are being fulfilled (and what related activities have been created for the tasks). Such tasks are displayed on the '''Follow-Up Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) form. 
*Those assigned to the users in your workgroup.
*Escalated tasks assigned to users of workgroups that are positioned, in the company tree, on levels lower than your workgroup but in the same node. 
((({S:Hint}You can hide a task, event, or other activity from external users by marking it ''Internal'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_20|Task] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306020|CR306020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_30|Event] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306030|CR306030]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form, respectively.
))){br}

To make the most important tasks noticeable to you at a glance, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_40_40|Event and Task Categories] ([~/?ScreenId=EP204040|EP204040]) form to associate different colors with different categories of tasks. For example, if you select red for the most important tasks, yellow for less important tasks, and green for normal tasks, you will see the tasks marked by exclamation marks (in the column with the '''!''' heading) highlighted with the respective colors. {br}

Tasks do not require approvals; they are completed by the assignees or canceled by the creators.

When you work with large amounts of data, filtering is a crucial capability of any system that you use to process and view the data. In Acumatica ERP, you can filter data on various forms, in reports, and in tables. You can also configure the layout of tables to meet your needs.{br}

In this topic, you will find information about filters in Acumatica ERP and details about how you can apply filters to forms, tables, and reports; you will also learn more about setting up a table layout.{br}{TOC}
==Using Filters==
By using filters in Acumatica ERP, you can find the information you want to view in a table and include only the data you need in a generated report. To help you meet your needs, Acumatica ERP provides the following types of filters, each of which has different purposes: simple, quick, advanced, and ad hoc.((({S:Hint}All Acumatica ERP filters are form-specific. That is, if a filter is set up for one form, you cannot apply it to another form.
)))
''Simple filters'' are filters you can apply quickly to data in any table. To use a simple filter, you click the header of the column to which you want to apply the filter and specify a condition for the column. The table now shows only the table rows for which this column meets this condition. For details on using simple filters, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Using_Simple_Filters|To Filter the Data in a Table].{br}

''Quick filters'' are filters you can apply to data in a table on a generic inquiry form (such as a substitute form for a data entry form). To use a quick filter, you drag to the filtering area above the table the header of the column to which you want to apply the filter. In the filtering area, you select the values of each added quick filter (if the column has a fixed set of options) or the filter condition of each quick filter (if the column has an unlimited number of values). {br}

Quick filters can be saved for future use. When you save the filter, the system adds to the table a tab with the filter applied. When you bring up the form in the future, this filter tab will be displayed. For details on how to work with quick filters, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Using_Simple_Filters|To Filter the Data in a Table] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Add_Reusable_Filter|To Save a Filter for Future Use].{br}

''Advanced filters'' are filters you can set up on processing and inquiry forms to filter the data when you open the form in the future. You can configure complex conditions for these filters. You can create and apply these filters any time you want to, and save them for future use. For more information on designing advanced filters, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Creating_Advanced_Filters|Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters]. {br}

You use the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box to add an advanced filter to a form. When you save the filter, the system adds to the table a tab with the filter applied. For details, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Using_Reusable_Filters|Saving of Filters for Future Use] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.{br}

''Ad hoc filters'' are filters for short-term use that you can set up on report forms (that is, the forms from which you run reports) to fine-tune the basic report parameters. These filters cannot be saved directly to be reused at a later time. However, you can set up report templates that contain the filtering and sorting settings you use for an ad hoc filter; you can save these templates and use them in future uses of the report form. {br}

For more information on designing ad hoc filters, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Creating_Advanced_Filters|Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters]. For more information on using ad hoc filters, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Add_Ad_Hoc_Filter|To Configure a Filter on a Report Form] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Modify_AdHoc_Filters|To Modify a Filter on a Report Form].{br}

You can create quick and advanced filters for your personal use or share them with other users. Shared filters are available to all users of the system. A user that has access to shared filters can modify or delete these filters through the form to which they are applied. Also, shared filters can be designed by a system administrator on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_90_10|Filters] ([~/?ScreenId=CS209010|CS209010]) form. For details on the shared filters, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__mng_Filters|Managing Shared Filters].
==Reusing Filters==
You can reuse filters on a particular processing or inquiry form in one of the following ways: [anchor|#_5b4f3a7d-d609-43c4-a532-8807f836abff]
*By creating and saving a quick filter directly on that generic inquiry form.
*By creating and saving an advanced filter in the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box directly on that form. For more information on the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__ref_Reusable_Filter_Settings_dialog|Filter Settings Dialog Box].
{br}

You can do the following:[anchor|#ul_bcm_2f5_1r]
*Create a filter and save it for later use, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Add_Reusable_Filter|To Save a Filter for Future Use]. For more information on designing complex filter conditions for advanced filters, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Creating_Advanced_Filters|Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Modify_Active_Clauses_Reusable_Filters|To Change the Active Clauses for an Advanced Filter].
*Update the clauses of an existing filter, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Modify_Reusable_Filter|To Modify a Saved Filter].
*Share a filter with other users, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Share_Reusable_Filter|To Share a Filter]. For more information on working with shared filters, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__mng_Filters|Managing Shared Filters].
*Delete an obsolete filter, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Delete_Reusable_Filter|To Delete a Filter].

==Adjusting the Table Layout==
You can adjust any table to meet your information needs. Adjustments that you make to a table affect only your user account and are not visible to other users. {br}

You can fine-tune the table in the following ways:[anchor|#ul_jzf_5p1_zq]
*Filter data in columns by using simple filters, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Using_Simple_Filters|To Filter the Data in a Table]
*Hide or display columns, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Hide_Display_Table_Columns|To Hide or Display Table Columns]
*Adjust the column widths, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Adjust_Column_Width|To Adjust Column Widths]
*Change the order of columns, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Change_Column_Order|To Change the Order of Columns]

When you make any of these changes, the table will display them immediately, and the system will save them automatically. These adjustments affect your user account when you access the form in the future.{br}

The '''Column Configuration''' dialog box, which is used to adjust the table layout, is described in [HelpRoot_Interface\TB__con_Table_Rows_and_Columns#_2f357643-1a28-4e29-a8da-17a4f668121e|Column Configuration Dialog Box] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.[anchor|#_4fae431b-136a-4624-8d75-a4c92c2d65e3]
==Personalizing Reports==
In addition to offering a comprehensive collection of reports for each module, Acumatica ERP gives you a high degree of control over each report. {br}

On a report form, as described in [HelpRoot_Interface\Preparing_to_Run_a_Report|Report Form], you can adjust the following report settings to meet your specific informational needs:[anchor|#_eef6e5e4-ef72-49da-9ed0-a2e92e0a27fa]
*Sorting conditions.
*Filtering conditions. For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Add_Ad_Hoc_Filter|To Configure a Filter on a Report Form] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Modify_AdHoc_Filters|To Modify a Filter on a Report Form].
*Report-specific settings—such as financial period, ledger, and account.
*Print and email settings.

For details on report configuration, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Run_Reports|To Run a Report].{br}

The settings of a particular report form can be saved as a report template for later use. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Create_Report_Templates|To Create, Remove, and Schedule a Report Template].

In Acumatica ERP, you can use simple and quick filters to quickly filter data in table columns. You can create two types of filters with complicated logical expressions to view only the data you need:[anchor|#_dce17994-fb36-4718-9b3b-ce8ebd36b85a]
*Advanced: An advanced filter is a filter you can set up on a processing or inquiry form to filter the data for future uses of the form.
*Ad hoc: An ad hoc filter is a filter for short-term use (the current session) that you can set up on a report form to fine-tune the basic report parameters.

This topic describes the design of advanced and ad hoc filters.{br}

For more information about filter types, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Personalize_Data_Representation|Data Presentation in Acumatica ERP] and [HelpRoot_Interface\Filter__con_Filter_Types|Types of Filters] in the Interface Guide.{br}{TOC}
==Filter Settings Table==
For both advanced and ad-hoc filters, you use the Filter Settings table to add, edit, delete, and manage filters. With advanced filters, the table is a part of the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box (for details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__ref_Reusable_Filter_Settings_dialog|Filter Settings Dialog Box]). With ad hoc filters, you can find the Filter Settings table on the '''Additional Sort and Filters''' tab of the report form; the table has the '''Additional Filtering Conditions''' heading. For more information about the tab, see [HelpRoot_Interface\Preparing_to_Run_a_Report|Report Form] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.
==Filter Clauses==
A filter clause is a part of a filter represented by a table row in the Filter Settings table. Any advanced or ad hoc filter consists of either one filter clause or multiple filter clauses. For each clause, you specify the following settings in the table row:[anchor|#ul_fh4_thf_1s]
*'''Property''': The entity type associated with the particular table or report that the filter will be applied to. You select a property from the list of available entity types. 
*'''Condition''': The logical operation that applies to the value of the selected property. You select a condition from the list of available conditions.
*'''Value''': The value for the logical condition used to filter the data. Depending on the selected property and condition, you enter a value (and sometimes a second value as well, depending on the condition). Each value must conform with the data type of the selected property. Generally, there are a series of fixed values are fixed for the property—for example, the ''Completed'' value for the ''Status'' property. For user-relative and date-relative clauses, described in detail in the [[#_2a79b8bb-e461-43cf-b440-2d0388974211|User-Relative Filter Clauses] and [[#_12755b03-7718-4fe5-af41-1a2981b7c175|Date-Relative Filter Clauses] sections in this topic, you can specify parameters, such as ''@Me'' and ''@Today''. The filtering process is not case-sensitive; that is, the system doesn&rsquo;t differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters in values.

To define a clause, you specify the property, the condition, and the applicable values in the table row. For example, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) form, you can search for completed tasks by specifying a filter that has ''Status'' specified as the property, ''Equals'' specified as the condition, and ''Completed'' specified as the value.{br}

You use ''And'' and ''Or'' operators and parentheses to group clauses into logical expressions. You use the ''And'' operator to find the records that meet the criteria in both the selected clause and the next clause. You use the ''Or'' operator to find the records that meet the criteria in either the selected clause or the next clause. You can use parentheses to combine clauses into units as parentheses are used in logical statements to define the order of operations. The ''And'' and ''Or'' operators work on a unit in parentheses as if the unit was a single clause.((({S:Hint}If you try to filter the data by using a string that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For example, if you try to filter the data by a customer name that contains the ''Customer&#95;Name'' string, the system will return all the customers whose name contains any of the following strings: ''Customer&#95;Name'', ''Customer-Name'', and ''Customer Name''. The reason that all of these strings will be returned is that the underscore is used as a wildcard character.

==User-Relative Filter Clauses==
To simplify the process of filtering data by owner or by workgroup, three predefined user-relative parameters are available in the system. By using these parameters, you can configure ''user-relative clauses''. When you use these parameters, you do not need to create multiple rows with specific values—for example, to specify each workgroup in which you are a member for the ''Workgroup'' property. Instead, you can use only one parameter, such as ''@MyGroups'', to filter the all records of workgroups you are a member of. {br}

You can find the full list of user-relative parameters below:[anchor|#_a6e50112-57ec-492a-8505-d0da35766900]
*{{@Me}}: The current user. This parameter can be used only for the user-related properties (such as ''Owner'' or ''Custodian'') that have ''Equal'' and ''Does Not Equal'' conditions.
*{{@MyGroups}}: The workgroups in which the current user is a member, excluding the workgroups that are the subordinates of these workgroups. You can use this parameter for the ''Workgroup'' property, which has the ''Is In'' and ''Is Not In'' conditions.
*{{@MyWorktree}}: The workgroups in which the current user is a member, including the groups that are subordinates of these groups according to the company tree structure. You can use this parameter for the ''Workgroup'' property, which has the ''Is In'' and ''Is Not In'' conditions.

For the user-relative clauses, the system will filter data by the user currently signed in (by using the ''@Me'' parameter), or by the workgroup or workgroups the signed-in user is a member of (by using the ''@MyGroups'' or ''@MyWorktree'' parameter).[anchor|#_12755b03-7718-4fe5-af41-1a2981b7c175]
==Date-Relative Filter Clauses==
To make date clauses in advanced filters more flexible, you can use date-relative parameters—parameters that are relative to the current date.((({S:Hint}[anchor|#_18e4252c-2421-42af-b3d1-17e88eb04157]
*Date-relative parameters cannot be used in ad hoc filters on report forms.
*For the date-relative parameters, the system uses as the current date the date (in coordinated universal time, or ''UTC'') of the server used to run the Acumatica ERP instance. Changing the business date (in the upper-right corner of the screen) does not affect the filter results.
)))
Below you can find the full list of date-relative parameters:[anchor|#_9c7db14c-bc80-4c0a-b6fe-f92953b92a55]
*{{@Today}}: The current date as specified on the server used to run your Acumatica ERP instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting days.
*{{@WeekStart}}: The start of the current week as specified on the server used to run your Acumatica ERP instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting weeks. 
*:((({S:Hint}The start and end of the week are determined according to the default system locale or the locale you selected when you signed in to Acumatica ERP. The system locales are specified and configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form.
)))
*{{@WeekEnd}}: The end of the current week as specified on the server used to run your Acumatica ERP instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting weeks.
*:((({S:Hint}The start and end of the week are determined according to the default system locale or the locale you selected when you signed in to Acumatica ERP. The system locales are specified and configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_50|System Locales] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) form.
)))
*{{@MonthStart}}: The start of the current month as specified on the server used to run your Acumatica ERP instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting months.
*{{@MonthEnd}}: The end of the current month as specified on the server used to run your Acumatica ERP instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting months.
*{{@QuarterStart}}: The start of the current quarter as specified on the server used to run your Acumatica ERP instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting quarters.
*{{@QuarterEnd}}: The end of the current quarter as specified on the server used to run your Acumatica ERP instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting quarters.
*{{@PeriodStart}}: The start of the current financial period. The financial periods are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_10_00|Financial Year] ([~/?ScreenId=GL101000|GL101000]) form, and the current date is specified on the server used to run your Acumatica ERP instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting financial periods. For more information on financial periods in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__MNG_Managing_Accounting_Cycle|Managing Financial Periods].
*{{@PeriodEnd}}: The end of the current financial period. The financial periods are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_10_10_00|Financial Year] ([~/?ScreenId=GL101000|GL101000]) form, and the current date is specified on the server used to run your Acumatica ERP instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting financial periods. For more information on financial periods in Acumatica ERP, see [HelpRoot_Financials\GL__MNG_Managing_Accounting_Cycle|Managing Financial Periods].
*{{@YearStart}}: The start of the current calendar year as specified on the server used to run your Acumatica ERP instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting years.
*{{@YearEnd}}: The end of the current calendar year as specified on the server used to run your Acumatica ERP instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting months.

To add a filter clause with a date-relative parameter, you select the parameter from the list.{br}

You can modify the parameters by adding or subtracting integers. The date is calculated according to the measurement of the parameter. For example, to view all tasks that are due next week, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_40_40_00|Tasks] form, you add a filter clause as follows: You specify ''Due Date'' as the property, ''Is Between'' as the condition, ''@WeekStart + 1'' as the first value, and ''WeekEnd + 1'' as the second value. ((({S:Hint}The system won&rsquo;t be able to find any records if the modified date is out of range, and will return an error.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters In  Acumatica ERP,     you can use simple and quick filters to quickly filter data in table columns. You can create two     types of filters with complicated logical expressions to view only the data you need: Advanced: An advanced filter is a filter you can set up on a processing or inquiry form to      filter the data for future uses of the form. Ad hoc: An ad hoc filter is a filter for short-term use (the current session) that you can      set up on a report form to fine-tune the basic report parameters. This topic describes the design of advanced and ad hoc filters. For more information about filter types, see  Data Presentation in Acumatica ERP and  Types of Filters in the Interface Guide. Filter Settings Table For both advanced and ad-hoc filters, you use the Filter Settings table to add, edit, delete,     and manage filters. With advanced filters, the table is a part of the  Filter      Settings  dialog box (for details, see  Filter Settings Dialog Box). With ad hoc filters, you can find the     Filter Settings table on the  Additional Sort and Filters  tab of the     report form; the table has the  Additional Filtering Conditions  heading.     For more information about the tab, see  Report Form in the  Acumatica ERP     Interface Guide. Filter Clauses A filter clause is a part of a filter represented by a table row in the Filter Settings table.     Any advanced or ad hoc filter consists of either one filter clause or multiple filter clauses.     For each clause, you specify the following settings in the table row: Property : The entity type associated with the particular table or      report that the filter will be applied to. You select a property from the list of available      entity types.  Condition : The logical operation that applies to the value of the      selected property. You select a condition from the list of available conditions. Value : The value for the logical condition used to filter the data.      Depending on the selected property and condition, you enter a value (and sometimes a second      value as well, depending on the condition). Each value must conform with the data type of the      selected property. Generally, there are a series of fixed values are fixed for the property—for      example, the  Completed  value for the  Status  property. For user-relative and      date-relative clauses, described in detail in the  User-Relative Filter Clauses User-Relative Filter Clauses and  Date-Relative Filter Clauses Date-Relative Filter Clauses sections in this topic, you can specify parameters, such as  @Me  and        @Today . The filtering process is not case-sensitive; that is, the system doesn't      differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters in values. To define a clause, you specify the property, the condition, and the applicable values in the     table row. For example, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) Tasks (EP404000) form, you can search for completed tasks by specifying a     filter that has  Status  specified as the property,  Equals  specified as the condition, and  Completed  specified as the value. You use  And  and  Or  operators and parentheses to group clauses into logical     expressions. You use the  And  operator to find the records that meet the criteria in both     the selected clause and the next clause. You use the  Or  operator to find the records that     meet the criteria in either the selected clause or the next clause. You can use parentheses to     combine clauses into units as parentheses are used in logical statements to define the order of     operations. The  And  and  Or  operators work on a unit in parentheses as if the unit     was a single clause. If you try to filter the data by using a string that contains an underscore, the result     will also contain the values with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For     example, if you try to filter the data by a customer name that contains the  Customer_Name      string, the system will return all the customers whose name contains any of the following     strings:  Customer_Name ,  Customer-Name , and  Customer Name . The reason that     all of these strings will be returned is that the underscore is used as a wildcard     character. For examples of filters, see  Examples of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters in the       Acumatica ERP Interface Guide. User-Relative Filter Clauses To simplify the process of filtering data by owner or by workgroup, three predefined     user-relative parameters are available in the system. By using these parameters, you can     configure  user-relative clauses . When you use these parameters, you do not need to create     multiple rows with specific values—for example, to specify each workgroup in which you are a     member for the  Workgroup  property. Instead, you can use only one parameter, such as       @MyGroups , to filter the all records of workgroups you are a member of.  You can find the full list of user-relative parameters below: @Me : The current user. This parameter can be used only for the       user-related properties (such as  Owner  or  Custodian ) that have  Equal  and         Does Not Equal  conditions. @MyGroups : The workgroups in which the current user is a member, excluding       the workgroups that are the subordinates of these workgroups. You can use this parameter for       the  Workgroup  property, which has the  Is In  and  Is Not In        conditions. @MyWorktree : The workgroups in which the current user is a member,       including the groups that are subordinates of these groups according to the company tree       structure. You can use this parameter for the  Workgroup  property, which has the  Is        In  and  Is Not In  conditions. For the user-relative clauses, the system will filter data by the user currently signed in (by     using the  @Me  parameter), or by the workgroup or workgroups the signed-in user is a     member of (by using the  @MyGroups  or  @MyWorktree  parameter). Date-Relative Filter Clauses To make date clauses in advanced filters more flexible, you can use date-relative     parameters—parameters that are relative to the current date. Date-relative parameters cannot be used in ad hoc filters on report forms. For the date-relative parameters, the system uses as the current date the date (in       coordinated universal time, or  UTC ) of the server used to run the  Acumatica ERP       instance. Changing the business date (in the upper-right corner of the screen) does not affect       the filter results. Below you can find the full list of date-relative parameters: @Today : The current date as specified on the server used to run your  Acumatica ERP       instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting days. @WeekStart : The start of the current week as specified on the server used       to run your  Acumatica ERP       instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting weeks.  The start and end of the week are determined according to the default system locale or the locale you selected when you signed in to  Acumatica ERP. The system locales are specified and configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales (SM200550) form. @WeekEnd : The end of the current week as specified on the server used to       run your  Acumatica ERP       instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting weeks. The start and end of the week are determined according to the default system locale or the locale you selected when you signed in to  Acumatica ERP. The system locales are specified and configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales (SM200550) form. @MonthStart : The start of the current month as specified on the server       used to run your  Acumatica ERP       instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting months. @MonthEnd : The end of the current month as specified on the server used to       run your  Acumatica ERP       instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting months. @QuarterStart : The start of the current quarter as specified on the server       used to run your  Acumatica ERP       instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting quarters. @QuarterEnd : The end of the current quarter as specified on the server       used to run your  Acumatica ERP       instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting quarters. @PeriodStart : The start of the current financial period. The financial       periods are defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL101000|GL101000]) Financial Year (GL101000) form,       and the current date is specified on the server used to run your  Acumatica ERP       instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting financial periods. For more       information on financial periods in  Acumatica ERP, see  Managing Financial       Periods Managing Financial Periods. @PeriodEnd : The end of the current financial period. The financial periods       are defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL101000|GL101000]) Financial Year (GL101000) form, and the current date is       specified on the server used to run your  Acumatica ERP       instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting financial periods. For more       information on financial periods in  Acumatica ERP, see  Managing Financial       Periods Managing Financial Periods. @YearStart : The start of the current calendar year as specified on the       server used to run your  Acumatica ERP       instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting years. @YearEnd : The end of the current calendar year as specified on the server       used to run your  Acumatica ERP       instance. You can modify this parameter by adding or subtracting months. To add a filter clause with a date-relative parameter, you select the parameter from the     list. You can modify the parameters by adding or subtracting integers. The date is calculated     according to the measurement of the parameter. For example, to view all tasks that are due next     week, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP404000|EP404000]) Tasks form, you add a filter clause as follows: You     specify  Due Date  as the property,  Is Between  as the condition,  @WeekStart +      1  as the first value, and  WeekEnd + 1  as the second value.

#In the table, do one of the following:
#*Click the header of the column whose values you want to filter.
#*If the '''Drag column header here to configure filter''' box of the filtering area is available above the table (which indicates that you are viewing a generic inquiry form), drag the header of the column whose values you want to filter to this part of the filtering area and click the button that is added to the filtering area once you drop the header there.
#If you want to filter data in a column with a fixed set of options (such as '''Status'''), in the dialog box that has opened, select the required values.
#If you want to filter data in a column with unlimited number of values (such as '''Vendor'''), do the following: 
#*In the dialog box that has opened, select the filter condition from the list of available conditions. The available conditions (such as '''Contains''', '''Equals''', or '''Is Null''') depend on the data type of the column.
#*In the box at the bottom of the dialog box, type the filter value (if needed).
#Click '''OK''' to apply the filter.

Now the table displays only the rows that satisfy the terms of the filter.

If you want to filter data in a column with a fixed set of options (such as                              Status ), in the dialog box that has opened,                         select the required values. If you want to filter data in a column with unlimited number of values (such                         as  Vendor ), do the following:  In the dialog box that has opened, select the filter condition from                                 the list of available conditions. The available conditions (such as                                      Contains ,  Equals ,                                 or  Is Null ) depend on the data type of the                                 column. In the box at the bottom of the dialog box, type the filter value                                 (if needed). Click  OK  to apply the filter. Now the table displays only the rows that satisfy the terms of the filter. The                     column header is highlighted and displays the filter icon ( ). If the table is on a                     generic inquiry form, a button is added to the filtering area and displays the                     column name and filtering value. You can set up filters for any number of table columns. If you set up filters for                     multiple columns, the system displays only the rows that satisfy the terms of                     all filters. To Filter Data by a Selected Cell Value You can filter the data in a table on an inquiry or processing form by a value of                     any cell that you select as follows: Open the form with the table for which you want to set up filtering by a                         cell value. In the table, right-click the cell that contains the value by which you want                         to filter the data, and click  Filter by This Cell                             Value . As a result, the table displays only the rows for which this column contains this                     value. The column header is highlighted and displays the filter icon ( ). If the table                     is on a generic inquiry form, a button is added to the filtering area and                     displays the column name and filtering value. You can also apply this filter by clicking the required cell and pressing                     SHIFT+F.  To Clear a Filter On the form with the table for which you want to clear a simple or quick filter,                     do one of the following: If there is a button with the filter in the filtering area, drag the button                         to the table. In the table, click the header of the column for which you want to clear the                         filter, and do one of the following: If you filtered data in a column with fixed set of options, click                                      Select All  and then click                                      OK . If you filtered data in a column with unlimited number of values,                                 click  Clear Filter . To Turn On Column Sorting Open the form with the table for which you want to set up column sorting. In the table, click the header of the column whose values you want to sort. In the dialog box, select the sorting order—ascending (that is, A to Z for text, lowest to                         highest for numbers, or newest to latest for dates) or descending (that is,                         Z to A for text, highest to lowest for numbers, or latest to newest for                         dates). The column header displays the ascending ( ) or descending ( ) sorting icon. You can turn on sorting for only one column in a table at a time. To Turn Off Column Sorting On the form with the table for which you want to clear column sorting, do the                     following: In the table, click the header of the column for which you want to clear                         sorting. Click the sorting option you have previously clicked. The column sorting is                         now turned off. ]]></column>

An advanced filter may contain active and inactive clauses; each clause is represented in one row of the table on the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box for the filter. When a filter is applied to a form, the active clauses are applied to the records in the list, and the inactive clauses are ignored. You can easily modify the advanced filter by changing the active status of the clauses before the filter is applied, as described in this topic. For details about the syntax of clauses, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Creating_Advanced_Filters|Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters].
==To Modify Active Clauses for an Advanced Filter==[anchor|#_84a7d155-5e4f-4209-9e5a-2e4684bd6992]

#If you want to exclude a clause from the filter, clear the '''Active''' check box that precedes the clause. Repeat this step for all clauses you want to make inactive.
#If you want to save the state of the clauses, click '''Save'''. (If you have made other changes in the filter settings, they also will be saved.)

In the  Execution Time  section, specify the particular                     time of the day to start and stop the processing as follows: In the  Starts On  box, select the hour and minute                             when the first execution of the schedule should start. If you want the processing to be stopped at specific time or you want                             the processing to be repeated multiple times a day, in the                                  Stops On  box, select the hour and minute when                             the first execution of the schedule should stop.  If execution of the schedule should be repeated multiple times a day, in                             the  Every  box, select the interval between                             successive executions of the schedule. In the  Next Execution Time  box, make sure the                             next execution time is correct. If you want the system to execute the schedule at exactly the time                             specified in the  Next Execution Time  box, select                             the  Exact Time  check box. If the check box is                             cleared, the system may shift the next execution time of the schedule by                             multiple minutes. Click  Save  on the form toolbar             to create the schedule. When you save a newly created schedule, the system gives it an             identifier in accordance with the built-in numbering sequence intended for automation             schedules.  After you have added a schedule for the report processing, the system will                     send the report with the parameters specified in the template according to the                     schedule settings. ]]></column>

==Data Table Widgets==
You can use tables as widgets on dashboards. A table is an arrangement of numerical data in rows and columns; it is designed to show a set of related facts in a compact, comprehensive form. Although tables are not as eye-catching as charts, they are often the best way to help the viewer grasp key ideas about the data. A table is often a better choice than a chart when you want to show multiple types (columns) of data. For details on data table widgets, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Tables|Data Table Widgets] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.{br}

For a step-by-step procedure on how to add a table to a dashboard, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_a_Table|To Add a Data Table Widget].[anchor|#_2e5cbdea-c4b5-4c1f-9065-55291223f701]
==Embedded Page Widgets==
You can embed a page from an external website as a widget on a dashboard. You may want to display important information from external systems (such as a currency rate or a document from external cloud storage) in Acumatica ERP to provide yourself and your colleagues (if they also use the dashboard) with consolidated information on one page. For details on embedded page widgets, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Embedded_Page|Embedded Page Widgets] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.{br}

For a step-by-step procedure on how to add a webpage to a dashboard, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_Embedded_Page|To Add an Embedded Page Widget].[anchor|#_ef7a687a-52ae-49bd-9697-c31a943990ad]
==Header Widgets==
During the design of a dashboard, you may need to organize widgets into sections and add a header of this section. To do this, you can use the header widget. For more information on the header widget, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Header|Header Widgets] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.{br}

For a step-by-step procedure on how to add a header widget to a dashboard, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_Header_Widget|To Add a Header Widget].[anchor|#_9f24b4c7-a3db-42bc-8bbf-87e172d8cbd4]
==Power BI Tile Widgets==
You can embed a Power BI tile on a dashboard. If you use Power BI tools for the monitoring and analysis of various data in your organization, you can display this information in Acumatica ERP to provide yourself and your colleagues (if they also use the dashboard) with all necessary business indicators on one page. For details on Power BI tile widgets, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_PowerBI|Power BI Tile Widgets] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.{br}

For a step-by-step procedure on how to add a Power BI tile to an Acumatica ERP dashboard, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_PowerBI|To Add a Power BI Tile Widget].[anchor|#_8ccb167a-3a69-49c0-8161-0477b1c57c22]
==Scorecard KPI Widgets==
You can add a scorecard KPI (key performance indicator) widget to a dashboard. Scorecards are useful when you need to monitor single parameters that are critical for particular business processes in your organization. For example, a scorecard can display the number of new support cases from customers. For details on scorecard KPI widgets, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Scorecard|Scorecard KPI Widgets] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.{br}

For a step-by-step procedure on how to add a scorecard KPI widget to a dashboard, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_Scorecard|To Add a Scorecard KPI Widget].[anchor|#_0c4508ce-34ce-4480-b02e-2c5f7f6d2b43]
==Trend Card KPI Widgets==
You can add a trend card KPI (key performance indicator) widget on a dashboard. A trend card KPI widget is useful when you want to display a trend of metrics that change over time. For example, you can display the total sum of closed deals in the current month in comparison to the sum in the previous month and see if it increases or decreases. For details on trend card KPI widgets, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Trend_Card|Trend Card KPI Widgets] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.{br}

For a step-by-step procedure on how to add a trend card KPI widget to a dashboard, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Adding_TrendCard|To Add a Trend Card KPI Widget].[anchor|#_365615b5-8ac9-4e27-b1a2-ce4fe628b3cf]
==Wiki Page Widgets==
A wiki page widget is a dashboard view of a wiki topic, generally one that you need to refer to frequently. You can add to a dashboard any wiki topics that you consider useful. For details on wiki page widgets, see [HelpRoot_Interface\DB__con_Articles|Wiki Page Widgets] in the Acumatica ERP Interface Guide.{br}

For more information on         the header widget, see  Header Widgets in the  Acumatica ERP Interface Guide. For a step-by-step procedure on how to add a header widget to a dashboard, see  To Add a Header Widget. Power BI Tile Widgets You can embed a Power BI tile on a dashboard. If you use Power BI tools for the monitoring         and analysis of various data in your organization, you can display this information in  Acumatica ERP to provide yourself and your colleagues (if they also use the dashboard) with all         necessary business indicators on one page. For details on Power BI tile widgets, see  Power BI Tile Widgets in the  Acumatica ERP Interface Guide. For a step-by-step procedure on how to add a Power BI tile to an  Acumatica ERP dashboard, see  To Add a Power BI Tile Widget. Scorecard KPI Widgets You can add a scorecard KPI (key performance indicator) widget to a dashboard. Scorecards         are useful when you need to monitor single parameters that are critical for particular         business processes in your organization. For example, a scorecard can display the number of         new support cases from customers. For details on scorecard KPI widgets, see  Scorecard KPI Widgets in the  Acumatica ERP Interface Guide. For a step-by-step procedure on how to add a scorecard KPI widget to a dashboard, see  To Add a Scorecard KPI Widget. Trend Card KPI Widgets You can add a trend card KPI (key performance indicator) widget on a dashboard. A trend         card KPI widget is useful when you want to display a trend of metrics that change over time.         For example, you can display the total sum of closed deals in the current month in         comparison to the sum in the previous month and see if it increases or decreases. For         details on trend card KPI widgets, see  Trend Card KPI Widgets in the  Acumatica ERP Interface Guide. For a step-by-step procedure on how to add a trend card KPI widget to a dashboard, see            To Add a Trend Card KPI Widget. Wiki Page Widgets A wiki page widget is a dashboard view of a wiki topic, generally one that you need to         refer to frequently. You can add to a dashboard any wiki topics that you consider useful.         For details on wiki page widgets, see  Wiki Page Widgets         in the  Acumatica ERP Interface Guide. For more information about  Acumatica ERP wiki concepts, see  Wiki Overview. For a step-by-step procedure on how to add a wiki page to a dashboard, see  To Add a Wiki Page Widget. ]]></column>

You can configure a dashboard to meet your needs if an administrator has given you sufficient access rights to the dashboard. When you change the layout of a dashboard, a copy of it is created, so you configure your own copy of the dashboard.{br}

This topic provides information on configuring dashboards.{br}{TOC}
==Preliminary Steps==
Before you modify a dashboard, plan how many widgets and which types you will add. We recommend that you add no more than seven to ten widgets to one dashboard. Otherwise, information on a dashboard may become hard to read for you. If you would like to see more widgets while keeping the dashboard readable, you can use a second monitor or divide widgets between multiple dashboards, based on the widget type or functional scope. 
==Configuration Steps==
The process of configuring a dashboard includes the following steps:[anchor|#_bc8dbb14-84e8-42ef-adee-9b4d5a1c2e8d]
#You open the dashboard that you want to configure. The way you open a dashboard depends on the dashboard location. For details on opening a dashboard page used as the home page or the module page, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Open_Dashboard|To Open a Dashboard]. If the needed dashboard is located elsewhere on the site map, you navigate there by using the menu and navigation pane.
#You create your personal copy of the dashboard by clicking the '''Create User Copy''' button on the title bar of the dashboard page. 
#:((({S:Hint}If you do not see the '''Create User Copy''' button on the title bar of the dashboard page, you do not have the appropriate rights to edit the dashboard.
)))
#You switch the dashboard to the design mode by clicking the '''Design''' button on the title bar of the dashboard page.
#Optional: You add new widgets to the dashboard. For details, see [[#_ca21e5bd-3685-4b8c-b59b-890e97198816|Addition of Widgets to a Dashboard].
#Optional: You remove widgets from the dashboard if you no longer need to have the information they display at hand. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Arranging_Widgets_on_a_Dashboard|To Arrange Widgets on a Dashboard].
#Optional: You edit the settings of a widget by clicking '''Edit''' on the widget toolbar to change its type or the data. For details, see [[#_ca21e5bd-3685-4b8c-b59b-890e97198816|Addition of Widgets to a Dashboard].
#Optional: You select a dashboard layout template and place widgets on the dashboard for convenient viewing of information. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\DB__how_Arranging_Widgets_on_a_Dashboard|To Arrange Widgets on a Dashboard].
#Optional: If you don&rsquo;t want to preserve the changes you have made, you reset the dashboard by clicking '''Reset to Default''' on the dashboard title bar to replace its widgets with the widgets from the original dashboard.
#Optional: You set the dashboard you configured as your Acumatica ERP home page. For a detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\User_Profile_Home_Page|To Define Your Home Page].

==Addition of Widgets to a Dashboard==
You can use widgets of different types on a dashboard. For more information on widget types, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Dashboards|Dashboards]. See the following procedures for details on adding the supported types of widgets:[anchor|#ul_fyd_gmv_ds]

==Adding Parameters to the Selection Area==
If you want to provide users with ability to filter data on widgets on the fly, you can add parameters to the Selection area of a dashboard; the functionality of these parameters is similar to that of the parameters in the Selection area of inquiry forms. When users select parameter values, the system filters the data on all applicable widgets by these values. You can configure filters for the following types of widgets (those that display data from generic inquiries):[anchor|#_7a7c1423-3d1d-45e8-987d-73d7a32868a0]
*Chart
*Data table
*Scorecard KPI
*Trend card KPI
[anchor|#_336c333e-74f3-4acd-aff4-710a4ec14369]((({S:Hint}Widget data can be filtered by the parameter value only if the inquiry form on which the widget is based contains data access class (DAC) field that is used by the parameter.
))){br}

To configure the filtering of data on widgets, you do the following:[anchor|#_5cab6fe4-2fbe-4031-8192-0be36f2c74d6]
#On the '''Parameters''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_86_00|Dashboards] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208600|SM208600]) form, you select the dashboard and then add one parameter or multiple parameters that will be displayed in the Selection area of the dashboard. 
#:((({S:Hint}If you do not have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_86_00|Dashboards] form, ask your system administrator to add the required parameter or parameters.
)))
#For each widget whose data should be filtered by the values of the added parameter or parameters, in the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box (which you can open by clicking the '''Filter Settings''' button in the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box), you select the parameters. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Add_Parameters_to_Widget_Properties|To Configure Filtering of Widget Data by Dashboard Parameters].

After the dashboard has been created, you populate it with widgets. Each type of widget has its own specific settings. (For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Dashboard_Configuration#_ca21e5bd-3685-4b8c-b59b-890e97198816|Addition of Widgets to a Dashboard] in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Dashboard_Configuration|Dashboard Configuration].) In this topic, you will read about configuring colors in chart widgets, filtering data on widgets, and updating information on widgets.[anchor|#_4a20b050-e166-42df-804a-499aecc762d0]
==Configuring Colors for Chart Widgets==
You can specify custom colors for series in chart widgets. Series can be displayed on the following types of chart widgets: line, column, stacked column, bar, and stacked bar. You may need to change the default colors of series, for example, to make the dashboard correspond to your corporate style.{br}

To specify the colors depending on the series values, you should use expressions in the '''Color''' box of the '''Chart Settings''' dialog box. For example, to make a chart element red if the series value is ''USD'' and blue if the series value is ''EUR'', you would specify the following expression: {{=Switch(Value = 'USD', '#FF0000', Value = 'EUR', '#0A26FF')}}. For details on expressions, see [HelpRoot_ReportingTools\Using_Expressions|Using Expressions].
==Filtering Data On Widgets==
On widgets that use inquiry forms as their data source (such as charts and scorecard KPI widgets), you can filter data by specific criteria. Acumatica ERP provides you with the following ways to filter data on a particular widget:[anchor|#_ce6c79ee-3e6d-4134-b5dd-28df6641a665]
*By using a shared filter: If any shared filters have been created for the inquiry form that is used as a data source for a widget, you can select any of these shared filters in the '''Shared Filter to Apply''' box in the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box to filter the data on the widget. Only users who can edit the dashboard can change the shared filters for a widget on the dashboard.
*By specifying filtering conditions: You can specify filtering conditions (as you can for reusable filters) in the '''Filter Settings''' dialog box. You open this dialog box by clicking '''Filter Settings''' in the '''Widget Properties''' dialog box, which you open for the widget by clicking Edit on the widget toolbar. (For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Creating_Advanced_Filters|Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters].) Only users who can edit the dashboard can change filter conditions for a widget on the dashboard.
*By using dashboard parameters: You can add parameters to a dashboard, and users can filter data on widgets as needed by selecting parameter values. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Dashboard_Configuration#_f0711e28-0735-43e7-ae16-6bbb1be1b451|Adding Parameters to the Selection Area] in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_Dashboard_Configuration|Dashboard Configuration].

==Updating Information on Widgets==
You can refresh the information on a particular widget by clicking '''Refresh''' in the top left corner of a widget toolbar.

In Acumatica ERP, there are standard actions that you can use almost everywhere in the system. With these actions, you can, for example, export data in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, attach files and notes to table records, and search for forms, records, or help topics.{br}

In this topic, you will read about system-wide actions in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Import and Export==
If you prefer to perform detailed financial analysis by using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, you can export data from Acumatica ERP to Excel or CSV formats. The system also supports import from these formats if, for example, you have some data that you want to process with Acumatica ERP. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\Exporting_to_Excel|Integration with Excel].[anchor|#_10008f0d-c70a-4b86-a53b-c4f7ccc24dc0]{br}

In Acumatica ERP, some record types, such as generic inquiries and ARM reports, have a complex structure. Sometimes, you may need to export data from these forms, for example, to transfer a generic inquiry to another instance. Then in the other instance, you need to import this generic inquiry. You can import and export these records in XML format. [anchor|#_01e5c70f-df4d-4f7e-8506-34b2ae7d2f2a]{br}

A form has XML export and import functionality when the '''Export as XML''' and '''Import from XML''' menu commands are available if you click '''Clipboard''' on the form toolbar after you select an entity. For example, navigate to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form, select an inquiry, and notice that this menu command is available. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\IS__how_XML_export|To Export Data to XML] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\IS__how_XML_import|To Import Data from XML].
==Search in Acumatica ERP==
Within Acumatica ERP, you can find help topics, files, notes, form titles, and ''entities'', such as vendors, customers, prospects, employees, leads, and cases by using the search capabilities.{br}

The system considers all possible forms of the keyword or phrase that you have entered, and the search results are listed from the most relevant to the least relevant. You can also search for exact matches of the entire keyword or phrase by enclosing it in quotation marks. For example, searching for ''“Western Star Trucks”'' will return only the customer with this exact name.{br}

For more information on turning on semantic search, see [HelpRoot_Install\how__Semantic_Search|Enabling Semantic Search for Microsoft SQL Server] in the Acumatica ERP Installation Guide.{br}

You start a search by typing a word, a part of a word, or a phrase into the '''Search''' box in the navigation pane, as described in [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Start_Search|To Start a Search]. If you want to find a form by its name, you can type the form name in the '''Search''' box. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Search_for_Form|To Search for a Form].{br}

If you need to search for files attached to records, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) form. You can search the files by the form to which the file was imported or by any combination of the following criteria:[anchor|#ul_nwt_4k5_zk]
*Any text contained in the file name
*The author or creator of the file
*The date range during which the file was added to the system
*The user who checked out or added the file

The system narrows the search results based on the access rights of the user who performs the search. If you don&rsquo;t have permissive access rights to particular data (such as vendor accounts), these objects will not appear in the search results, even though they match the search criteria. Your access rights to file attachments are determined by your rights to the entities to which the files are attached.
==Note and File Attachments==
In Acumatica ERP, files can be attached to any record that the system keeps for the objects—such as invoices, leads, customers, bills, sales orders, and batches of transactions—that users add by using data entry forms. You can attach different files, such as images in various formats, scanned documents, and internal instructions for employees. The value in parentheses to the right of the '''File''' menu on the form title bar shows the number of files attached to the selected record. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Attach_Files_to_Records|To Attach a File to a Record].{br}

If you need to, you can attach files to any detail of a record (that is, an object, entity, or document created by using a form). A record detail is a particular row in the record that a user has added by using the data entry form. For the procedure, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Attach_Files_to_Record_Details|To Attach a File to a Record Detail].{br}

You can easily manage and track files and images attached to Acumatica ERP records and record details for various purposes. For more information on managing attached files, see [HelpRoot_Administration\DM__mng_File_Attachements|Managing Attached Files].{br}

In addition to attaching files, you can attach text notes to records. You can use these notes to communicate key information about the record or record detail to other users. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Attach_Notes_to_Records|To Attach a Note to a Record]. As with files, you can attach notes to record details. For a procedure, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Attach_Notes_to_Record_Details|To Attach a Note to a Record Detail].
==Document and Object Creation==
In Acumatica ERP, you can create a document (such as a bill, invoice, or sales order) and an object (such as a vendor or customer class) in the following ways:[anchor|#_dc6cf085-63cf-4de2-8bde-067674f39907]
*From scratch: You fill in all necessary elements of a document or object from the beginning.
*By using a copy-and-paste option: You copy and paste a document or object of the same type.
*By using a template: You use a previously created template of a document or object that contains some default fields.

If you use templates or copying and pasting, these processes make creation of documents and objects much easier because you need to fill in or change fewer elements. For applicable forms, you can find the copying and pasting options and a list of templates in the '''Clipboard''' menu on the form toolbar. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Copy_Documents|To Copy a Document Contents to a New Document] and [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Create_Document_Using_Template|To Create a Document by Using a Template].{br}

For more information, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\SM__con_Copy-and-Paste_Options_and_Document_Templates|Copy-and-Paste Options and Document Templates].

During the normal course of business, you may need to enter recurring or similar documents—some of which include many lines—repeatedly. To help you minimize input errors and save time, Acumatica ERP provides document templates and copy-and-paste options for many forms. When you&rsquo;re creating a new document or object, you can use either functionality to ease this process. {br}{TOC}
==Copying and Pasting==
In Acumatica ERP, you can easily create a new document by copying and pasting an existing document of the same type. This functionality can also be used to create new objects, such as vendor or customer classes, by copying existing objects. For applicable forms, the copying and pasting options are offered on the '''Edit''' menu on the form toolbar. {br}

Because classes are usually created during implementation, there is seldom a need to save and keep templates for them, but it may be helpful later to copy and paste an existing class. Generally, you first create the default vendor or customer class that includes the values that suit most vendors or customers; when you create a new class, you will see elements filled in with the values from the default class. With copy-and-paste functionality, you can create a new class based on a non-default class. To do so, complete the following steps: 
#On the appropriate form, bring up the class you want to copy.
#On the '''Clipboard''' menu on the form toolbar, select '''Copy'''.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Insert''' to clear the elements for a new object.
#On the '''Clipboard''' menu, select '''Paste'''.
#Type the name for the new class.
#Edit the elements with different values for the new class than for the original class.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Save''' to save the new class.

This functionality works similarly for documents and objects; bring up the appropriate form for the document or object and follow the instructions above. 
==Using Templates==
You can create an unlimited number of templates for various documents—such as bills, invoices, sales orders, or purchase orders—through the appropriate Data Entry forms. You can also use templates for most objects created by forms in the Maintenance sections. These objects include customer and vendor classes, stock and non-stock items, warehouses, kit specifications, and mailing lists. Also, you can create templates for customer or vendor business accounts. You even can create a template of a chart of inter-branch account mapping. {br}

Template features include the following: 
*All element values can be changed.
*Default values can be used (rather than values determined by the template) for correct date calculations.
*New lines can be added to a template or to a template-based new document.
*The template doesn&rsquo;t have to be a complete document with all the elements filled in.
*Templates have user-provided names.

Once you open a document that you want to use as a template for similar documents, create the template based on the document as follows: 
#On the '''Clipboard''' menu on the form toolbar, select '''Save as Template'''. 
#:The system navigates to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_90_20|Document Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=SM209020|SM209020]) form, where you can see the selected document with all its values.
#Provide a brief description for the template. This description will also be used as the template identifier.
#In the '''Values''' table, make sure that no element holds the document reference number; a new reference number will be generated for any document based on this template.
#For date- or period-related elements (such as document date, post period, due date, and cash discount date), clear the '''Active''' check boxes. For any new document, another date will be needed. Values based on the document date will be calculated automatically, based on the document date and the credit terms associated with the customer or vendor.
#Also clear the '''Active''' check box for the vendor or customer reference number provided for the document. You need to type new values for new documents.
#Save the template.

==Testing the Template==
To test the template, proceed as follows: 
#Return to the initial form that was used to create the template.
#Click '''Insert''' on the form toolbar.
#On the '''Clipboard''' menu, select the '''Paste''' option.
#Check that the document or object has the appropriate date, post period, and amounts. If so, click '''Save''' on the form toolbar; if not, modify the template by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_90_20|Document Templates] form accordingly: 
#*If some of the values inherited from the original document or object are not appropriate, modify the values.
#*If some of the elements should have default values rather than values from the template, clear the respective '''Active''' check box.
#*Save the template.

If needed, repeat these steps to test the template again.

The system navigates to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM209020|SM209020]) Document Templates (SM209020) form, where you 						can see the selected document with all its values. Provide a brief description for the template. This description will also be used 					as the template identifier. In the  Values  table, make sure that no element holds the document 					reference number; a new reference number will be generated for any document 					based on this template. For date- or period-related elements (such as document date, post period, due 					date, and cash discount date), clear the  Active  check boxes. For any new 					document, another date will be needed. Values based on the document date will be 					calculated automatically, based on the document date and the credit terms 					associated with the customer or vendor. Also clear the  Active  check box for the vendor or customer reference 					number provided for the document. You need to type new values for new 					documents. Save the template. Testing the Template To test the template, proceed as follows:  Return to the initial form that was used to create the template. Click  Insert  on the form toolbar. On the  Clipboard  menu, select the  Paste  					option. Check that the document or object has the appropriate date, post period, and amounts. If so, 					click  Save  on the form toolbar; if not, modify the template by using the 						  ([~/?ScreenId=SM209020|SM209020]) Document Templates form accordingly:  If some of the values inherited from the original document or object are 							not appropriate, modify the values. If some of the elements should have default values rather than values 							from the template, clear the respective  Active  check box. Save the template. If needed, repeat these steps to test the template again.   ([~/?ScreenId=SM209020|SM209020]) ]]></column>

Many users, having worked with Microsoft Excel for years, prefer to perform detailed financial analysis by using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet on their desktop. For such users, Acumatica ERP supports integration with Microsoft Excel.[anchor|#_0073c227-693f-4e3d-bfca-96f3a049f9d2]((({S:Hint}Acumatica ERP uses the spreadsheet format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, so if you use an earlier version of Microsoft Office, you should install the appropriate plug-in.
))){br}{TOC}
==Exporting to Excel==
You can export data from any Acumatica ERP table to an Excel spreadsheet any time you want to. For the detailed procedure, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Export_Data_to_Excel|To Export Data to Excel].{br}

The general settings your organization uses for export are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form. 
==Updating Excel Spreadsheets==
If you have exported data from an inquiry form to an Excel file, you can update your Excel file with data from the Acumatica ERP database. You can retrieve the data from the web and update the file contents without re-exporting data from the system and repeating all post-export configuration steps.[anchor|#_0e5e6678-1142-4b16-8048-339cd64bc8fc]((({S:Hint}Acumatica ERP uses the spreadsheet format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, so if you use an earlier version of Microsoft Office, you should install the appropriate plug-in.
)))
The contents of the file are updated with the filtering criteria you have specified on the inquiry form before exporting the data. If the filtering criteria includes the default values, these values will be updated as well. For example, if the filtering criteria includes the current financial period, when the period is changed in the system, it will be automatically updated in the file.{br}

For details on updating a spreadsheet, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\Exporting_to_Excel__how_update|To Update an Excel Spreadsheet].
==Aggregating Excel Spreadsheets==
Additionally, you can aggregate data from multiple forms to one Excel workbook and use the file as you want—for example, as a source for summarizing and analyzing data. To aggregate data in this way, do the following:[anchor|#ol_bkd_n1x_lk]
#Export data from each form you want to use.
#Copy the sheets from the exported files to one Excel workbook, and save the resulting file.

Once you have performed these steps, when you refresh data in Excel, the data on all spreadsheets will be updated simultaneously.[anchor|#_36b54c20-1acd-4773-b3c6-ffdb15ee4e81]((({S:Hint}Acumatica ERP uses the spreadsheet format introduced in Microsoft Office 2007, so if you use an earlier version of Microsoft Office, you should install the appropriate plug-in.
)))
==Importing from Excel==
With Acumatica ERP, you can easily import data from an Excel spreadsheet into a table on a data entry form—for example, you can import the details of a bill on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_30_10_00|Bills and Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Import_Data_From_File|To Import Data from a Local File to a Table].

You can export data to an XML file from any form that supports this functionality. A form has this functionality when the '''Export as XML''' menu command is available if you click '''Clipboard''' on the form toolbar after you select an entity. For example, navigate to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form, select an inquiry, and notice that this menu command is available. For more information about import, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__con_System_Wide_Actions|System-Wide Actions in Acumatica ERP].
==To Export Data to XML==[anchor|#_xv4_ptq_mg]
#Open the form whose data you want to export.
#In the summary or selection area (if the form has such an area), use the form elements or navigation buttons to select the record you want to export.
#On the form toolbar, click '''Clipboard''' > '''Export as XML'''.
#Follow the necessary steps, which depend on your browser and settings, to download the XML file with the exported data.

In the modern user interface of Acumatica ERP, you can specify your personal settings so that the UI better corresponds to your work responsibilities. For a description of the modern user interface, see [HelpRoot_Interface\UIG__con_New_UI|Modern Acumatica ERP User Interface].{br}

In this topic, you will read about the ways the user interface can be personalized.{br}{TOC}
==Personal Settings of the Acumatica ERP User Interface==
You can personalize the user interface of the system as follows:[anchor|#_6800ae2d-218e-437f-a973-c4bc373e2d94]
*Personalize the list of workspaces shown in the main menu. For details, see [[#_388c704b-ce6c-4bfe-8934-8c542bc2bfaa|Personalization of the Workspace List in the Main Menu].
*For each workspace, personalize the list of forms and reports shown in the Quick Menu. For more information, see [[#_40b7b689-242b-45ea-b7b3-ffa3007924fa|Personalization of Quick Menu of a Workspace].
*Change the location and size of the main menu. For details, see [[#_df796c0b-c2ad-4add-ba29-09dd670968b3|Changes to the Location and Size of the Main Menu].
[anchor|#_388c704b-ce6c-4bfe-8934-8c542bc2bfaa]
==Personalization of the Workspace List in the Main Menu==
In the modern user interface, the links to forms and reports are organized in workspaces, each of which corresponds to a functional area in the system. The main menu displays menu items corresponding to these workspaces (such as '''Finance''' or '''Banking'''); you can click any menu item.{br}

You can configure the list of workspaces displayed on the main menu panel by pinning and unpinning workspaces. You can pin to the panel only the workspaces that you use in your work frequently. Other workspaces you can access that are unpinned from the panel are hidden under '''More Items'''. You can pin and unpin the main menu items any time you need to (for example, when your work responsibilities change).{br}

For the steps you perform to pin and unpin a workspace on the main menu panel, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Pin_Unpin_Workspaces|To Pin and Unpin a Workspace on the Main Menu Panel].[anchor|#_40b7b689-242b-45ea-b7b3-ffa3007924fa]
==Personalization of Quick Menu of a Workspace==
When you click a menu item in the main menu, the system opens the Quick Menu of the workspace that corresponds to the menu item. You can use this menu to quickly access the forms and reports that you use during your work. You can configure the list of forms and reports in the Quick Menu for each workspace. We recommend that you display on the Quick Menu only forms and reports that you use frequently. By clicking the workspace header, you can view the links to all forms and reports of the workspace to which you have access.{br}

For a description of how to configure links to forms and reports in the Quick Menu, see [HelpRoot_GettingStarted\GS__how_Configure_Quick_Menu|To Configure the Quick Menu Items].{br}

You can reset your personal changes to the list of items displayed in the Quick Menu of a workspace and revert to the list of items that a system administrator configured for the Quick Menu. To do this, you switch to the '''Configuration''' mode and, on the workspace title bar, click '''Reset to Default'''.[anchor|#_df796c0b-c2ad-4add-ba29-09dd670968b3]
==Changes to the Location and Size of the Main Menu==
By default, the main menu is located on the left side of the screen and is displayed in its maximum size. If you need more space in the working area of the screen (for example, to work with forms more conveniently), you can change the location and size of the main menu panel as follows:[anchor|#_447afe57-f40c-4b1d-9050-6bc0df79b0de]
*Collapse the menu panel so that only the icons of menu items are displayed by clicking ([image:UserGuide/Images/Main_Menu_Collapse_to_Left_Button.png|15px]) in the bottom right corner of the main menu panel.
*Collapse the menu panel to a button in the top left corner of the screen by clicking ([image:UserGuide/Images/Main_Menu_Dots.png|15px]) in the bottom left corner of the main menu panel and selecting '''Collapse to Top'''.
*Display only icons on the '''Menu''' button and in titles of the main menu items. To do this, you click '''Menu''' and then click ([image:UserGuide/Images/Main_Menu_Collapse_to_Left_Button.png|15px]) in the bottom right corner of the main menu panel.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[Every organization has its own established processes of document review and approval. For documents of specific types, more than one approval may be required. By enabling the ''Approval Workflow'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form and setting up approval maps in Acumatica ERP, your organization can reduce the time required for document assignment and routing because the system provides automatic assignment for all the required approvals. Also, Acumatica ERP streamlines the approval workflow by providing a single form, [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]), that you can use as a starting point for all documents that require approval. For details, see [HelpRoot_Organization\EP__con_Assignment_Automation|Managing Assignment and Approval Maps]. {br}{TOC}
==Visibility Options==
 By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form, you can perform approvals of documents of multiple types, including cash transactions, purchase orders, requisition requests, requisitions, expense claims, time cards, and equipment time cards.{br}

By using the filter tabs on the form, you can view documents grouped in any of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_izh_xfs_r3]
*All documents that you can approve, including escalated documents assigned to users of workgroups that are at lower levels in the company tree but in the node of your workgroup
*Documents that are assigned to you for approval
*Documents that are assigned to the users of your workgroup
((({S:Hint}With some types of documents, such as expense claims or employee time cards, although you are allowed to approve documents assigned to other users of your workgroup, you may not be able to view the details of these documents on corresponding entry forms due to the specifics of the document visibility settings effective on these forms.
)))
==Approval or Rejection of Documents==
As an approver, you can either reject or approve a particular document. You can approve or reject all the documents listed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] form or only the documents you select. To approve particular documents, you need to select the unlabeled check box for each document and then click '''Approve'''.{br}

If the approval map for a particular type of document is configured so that entering a reason is required to complete document approval or rejection, such documents cannot be approved or rejected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] form. In this case, approvers can use only the corresponding entry form to approve or reject documents of that type.((({S:Hint}If a document that requires multiple approvals is first approved by a member of a workgroup located (on the company tree) above any of the assigned workgroups, the document immediately becomes approved by the lower groups, regardless of whether those groups have actually performed their approvals. 
)))
If you reject a document, the system assigns the ''Rejected'' status to it. Rejected documents cannot be removed from the system; they are stored with the history of approvals. If your organization&rsquo;s policies allow the editing of rejected documents, users can modify the rejected documents. Any modification removes all approval records for the document, and the approval process can be started again from the lowest level.

When you add a new widget by using this dialog box, you perform two steps. In the first step, you select the type of the widget that you want to add to the dashboard; the system brings up the version of the '''Add Widget''' dialog box that is specific to the widget type. In the second step, you specify the properties that are specific to the selected widget type. When you modify an existing widget, you perform only the second step.

((({S:Hint}If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that contains the ''Customer&#95;Name'' string, the system will return all the customers whose name contains any of the following strings: ''Customer&#95;Name'', ''Customer-Name'', and ''Customer Name''. The reason that all of these strings will be returned is that the underscore is used as a wildcard character.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Add Widget Dialog Box for Chart Widgets You use the  Add                 Widget  dialog box to add a widget to a dashboard and to modify an             existing widget. The settings that you need to specify depend on the widget type. When                 you add a new widget by using this dialog box, you perform two steps. In the first                 step, you select the type of the widget that you want to add to the dashboard; the                 system brings up the version of the  Add Widget  dialog box                 that is specific to the widget type. In the second step, you specify the properties                 that are specific to the selected widget type. When you modify an existing widget,                 you perform only the second step. (In this case, the system immediately brings up                 the appropriate version of the dialog box.) Add Widget Dialog Box: Step 1 When you want to add a new widget to a dashboard, you first need to select the option button         representing the type of the widget in the  Add Widget  dialog box. The         elements of the dialog box are described in the table below. Element Description Widget Type The type of widget to be added to the dashboard, which can be one of the following: Chart : A graphical representation of data from an                            Acumatica ERP form.

Data Table : Data from an  Acumatica ERP form arranged into rows and columns. For more information, see  Data Table Widgets. Embedded Page : A document or image that is stored                         on an external resource, such as cloud storage, and should be displayed on                         the dashboard. For more information, see  Embedded Page Widgets. Header : The title of the widget section. For                         details, see  Header Widgets. Power BI Tile : A chart, scorecard, or other type of                         analytical information that is represented on Power BI dashboards designed                         by your organization. For more information, see  Power BI Tile Widgets. Scorecard KPI : A parameter that is important for                         the business processes of your organization and that should be monitored on                         a daily basis.

For                                 example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that                                 contains the  Customer_Name  string, the system will return all                                 the customers whose name contains any of the following strings:                                      Customer_Name ,  Customer-Name , and  Customer                                     Name . The reason that all of these strings will be returned                                 is that the underscore is used as a wildcard                             character. Use                                 Parameter A check box that indicates (if selected) that a dashboard parameter                             is used in the filtering condition. When this check box is selected,                             only active dashboard parameters are displayed in the  Value                                 1  and  Value 2  columns. Value 1 The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the                             data, if the selected condition requires a value. The value you enter                             must conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter                             or select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters.  The predefined parameters are listed in  Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters. Value 2 The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical                             condition requires a second value. (For example, the  Is Between                              logical condition requires a second value.) The value you enter must                             conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter or                             select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters. The predefined parameters are listed in  Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters. Brackets A group of closing brackets to group logical conditions. Operator The logical operator to be used between groups of logical                             conditions. Chart Settings Dialog Box You can use this dialog box to specify properties that are specific to the chart           type. Element Description Chart Type Required. The type of chart widget you want to add. The following options are                 available:  Doughnut : A doughnut chart widget Line : A line chart widget Column : A column chart widget Stacked Column : A stacked column chart widget Bar : A bar chart widget Stacked Bar : A stacked bar chart widget Funnel : A funnel chart widget For more information, see  Dashboards. Legend Position The location of the legend on the widget. The box is displayed for only                 doughnut and funnel chart types. The following options are available: None : The legend is not displayed on the widget. Left : The legend is located to the left of the chart. Right : The legend is located to the right of the chart. Top : The legend is located above the chart. Bottom : The legend is located below the chart. Popup : The user can open the legend as a pop-up box by clicking the                     icon in the bottom left corner of the widget. This is the default value. The  Categories  section of the                 dialog box includes the following elements. Legend Required. The column from the source form whose values are used for categories.                 The values of the selected column are displayed on the chart as follows, depending                 on the chart type: Doughnut : The column values are displayed as individual sectors on the                     doughnut. The size of each sector is determined by the aggregated column value                     selected in the  Value  box. For example, a category might                     be a customer ID, a financial period, or a cash account. Line : The column values are displayed on the horizontal axis. Column : The column values are displayed on the horizontal axis. Stacked Column : The column values are displayed on the horizontal                     axis. Bar : The column values are displayed on the vertical axis. Stacked Bar : The column values are displayed on the vertical axis. Funnel : The column values are displayed as individual slices in the                     funnel. The height of each slice is determined by an aggregated column value                     selected in the  Value  box. For example, a column might be                     a customer ID. Sort By The sort order for the legend data. The left box defines the sequence to be                 sorted as follows:  Legend : The legend data is sorted by the values in the column you                     selected in the  Legend  box. Legend Values : The legend data is sorted by value you selected in the                        Value  box.  The right box defines the sort order. The way the values are sorted depends                   on the chart type as well as this selection. The following options are                   available: Ascending : Doughnut : The smallest sector is displayed in the upper part of the                         doughnut, and larger sectors are displayed clockwise in ascending                         order. Line ,  Column , and  Stacked Column : The lowest value                         (the first alphabetic value for text data) appears in the left part of the                         horizontal axis, and higher values are shown to the right in ascending                         order. The function ignores null values. Bar  and  Stacked Bar : The lowest value (the first alphabetic                         value for text data) appears in the upper part of the vertical axis, and                         higher values are arranged downward along the vertical axis in ascending                         order. The function ignores null values. Funnel : The lowest value (the first alphabetic value for text data)                         appears on the top of the funnel, and higher values are arranged downward in                         ascending order. The function ignores null values. Descending : Doughnut : The largest sector is displayed in the upper part of the                         doughnut, and smaller sectors are displayed clockwise in descending                         order. Line ,  Column  and  Stacked Column : The highest value                         (the last alphabetic value for text data) appears in the left part of the                         horizontal axis, and lower values are shown to the right in descending                         order. The function ignores null values. Bar  and  Stacked Bar : The highest value (the last alphabetic                         value for text data) appears in the upper part of the vertical axis, and                         lower values are arranged downward along the vertical axis in descending                         order. The function ignores null values. Funnel : The highest value (the last alphabetic value for text data)                         appears on the top of the funnel, and lower values are arranged downward in                         descending order. The function ignores null values. The default values in these boxes depend on the type             of the field that you selected in the  Legend  box, as described         below: String  type: The default value for the sequence in the left box is                          Legend Values  and for the sort order in the right box is                          Descending . Other types (for example,  Date  or  Sum ): The default value for the                     sequence in the left box is  Legend  and for the sort order in the right                     box is  Ascending . Maximum Number of Values Shown The maximum number of values to be individually shown             on the chart. The system always selects the values starting from the largest ones. If             you want the system to individually display all values, set the value of this box to             0. The default value of this box is 10. Show Sum of Other Entries A check box that indicates (if selected) that the             values that are not among the largest values (whose number is specified in the                  Maximum Number of Values Shown  box) are summed and shown on             the chart as a single element, with the element type depending on the chart type. For             example, for a doughnut chart, the element is a separate sector, and for a line chart,             it is a separate point. By default, this check box is cleared. Date Rounding The part of the date field that is displayed on             the chart widget. You can use on the chart either the full date or a particular part of             it (for example, a month or a year). This property is available only for fields of the                 date type. Select one of the following values: None : The full date is used in the chart. Minutes : Only minutes from the selected date field are used in the                     chart. Hours : Only hours from the selected date field are used in the                     chart. Days : Only days of month from the selected date field are used in the                     chart. Months : Only months from the selected date field are used in the                     chart. Quarters : Only quarters are used in the chart. The system calculates the                     quarter based on the date in the selected date field. Years : Only years from the selected date field are used in the                     chart. Format The format of the field value that is             selected in the  Legend  box. This box is displayed only for fields             of numeric and date types. You can select one of the predefined formats from the list.                  By default, the box is empty, which means that the field is not             formatted. The  Series  section of the dialog box includes the elements                   listed below. This section is available for the following chart types:  Line ,                      Column ,  Stacked Column ,  Bar , and  Stacked Bar . Legend The source column for the chart content. The values of the selected column are                   displayed on the chart as follows, depending on the chart type. Line : The column values are displayed as separate lines in the data                       area of the chart. Column : The column values are displayed as separate columns for each                       category. Stacked Column : The column values are displayed as sections of the                       chart column for each category. Bar : The column values are displayed as separate bars for each                       category. Stacked Bar : The column values are displayed as sections of a bar for                       each category. Sort By The sort order for the legend data. The left box defines the sequence to be                 sorted as follows:  Legend : The legend data is sorted by the values in the column you                     selected in the  Legend  box. Legend Values : The legend data is sorted by value you selected in the                        Value  box.  The way the values are sorted depends on the chart type as well as this                   selection. The following options are available: Ascending : Line ,  Stacked Column , and  Bar : The lowest value (the                         first alphabetic value for text data) appears in the upper part of the                         vertical axis, and higher values are arranged downward along the vertical                         axis in ascending order. The function ignores null values. Column  and  Stacked Bar : The lowest value (the first                         alphabetic value for text data) appears in the left part of the horizontal                         axis, and higher values are shown to the right in ascending order. The                         function ignores null values.  Descending : Line ,  Stacked Column , and  Bar : The highest value (the                         last alphabetic value for text data) appears in the upper part of the                         vertical axis, and lower values are arranged downward along the vertical                         axis in descending order. The function ignores null values. Column  and  Stacked Bar : The highest value (the last                         alphabetic value for text data) appears in the left part of the horizontal                         axis and lower values are shown to the right in descending order. The                         function ignores null values. The default values in these boxes depend on the type             of the field that you selected in the  Legend  box, as described         below: String  type: The default value for the sequence in the left box is                          Legend Values  and for the sort order in the right box is                          Descending . Other types (for example,  Date  or  Sum ): The default value for the                     sequence in the left box is  Legend  and for the sort order in the right                     box is  Ascending . Maximum Number of Values Shown The maximum number of values to be individually shown             on the chart. The system always selects the values starting from the largest ones. If             you want the system to individually display all values, set the value of this box to             0. The default value of this box is 10. Show Sum of Other Entries A check box that indicates (if selected) that the             values that are not among the largest values (whose number is specified in the                  Maximum Number of Values Shown  box) are summed and shown on             the chart as a single element, with the element type depending on the chart type. For             example, for a doughnut chart, the element is a separate sector, and for a line chart,             it is a separate point. By default, this check box is cleared. Date Rounding The part of the date field that is displayed on             the chart widget. You can use on the chart either the full date or a particular part of             it (for example, a month or a year). This property is available only for fields of the                 date type.

Color The custom colors of chart elements for the values defined in the                    Series  section. The colors should be specified by using                 expressions. You can open the  Expression Editor  dialog box by                 clicking the magnifier icon. For details, see  Widget Configuration. The  Values  section of the                 dialog box includes the following elements. Value A column from the source form. The values of the selected column are displayed                 on the chart as follows, depending on the chart type: Doughnut : The aggregated column values determine the size of the chart                     sectors. For example, a value might be an invoiced sales amount. Line : The column values are displayed on the vertical axis and are used                     as a source for the data area. Column : The column values are displayed on the vertical axis and are                     used as a source for the data area. Stacked Column : The column values are displayed on the vertical axis                     and determine the height of each section on a chart column. Bar : The column values are displayed on the horizontal axis and are                     used as a source for the data area. Stacked Bar : The column values are displayed on the horizontal axis and                     determine the length of each section on a bar. Funnel : The column values determine the height of each slice. For                     example, a value might be an invoices sales amount. Aggregation Function The aggregate function used to perform a calculation on the column of data                   selected in the  Value  box and return a single value, such as the total of                   the values or the number of selected rows in the column. The following aggregate                   functions are available:  Average : Calculates the average value in the column. Count : Determines the number of items in the column. Max : Determines the item with the highest value in the column. (For                     text data, the highest value is the last alphabetic value.) This function                     ignores null values. Min : Determines the item with the lowest value in the column. (For text                     data, the lowest value is the first alphabetic value.) This function ignores                     null values. Sum : Calculates the sum of the items in the column. This is the default                     value. Format The format of the field value that is selected in the                      Value  box. You can specify any of the standard formats                   defined for the format function in .Net. By default, the box is empty, which means that the field is not formatted. The dialog box has the following buttons. OK Saves your changes to the widget properties, and closes the dialog box. ]]></column>

When you add a new widget by using this dialog box, you perform two steps. In the first step, you select the type of the widget that you want to add to the dashboard; the system brings up the version of the '''Add Widget''' dialog box that is specific to the widget type. In the second step, you specify the properties that are specific to the selected widget type. When you modify an existing widget, you perform only the second step. (In this case, the system immediately brings up the appropriate version of the dialog box.){br}{TOC}[anchor|#_27e421b1-4c50-4a53-a02f-c436f925f81b]

*''Is Not Null'': Returns ''TRUE'' if the field value is not null.
((({S:Hint}If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that contains the ''Customer&#95;Name'' string, the system will return all the customers whose name contains any of the following strings: ''Customer&#95;Name'', ''Customer-Name'', and ''Customer Name''. The reason that all of these strings will be returned is that the underscore is used as a wildcard character.
)))
|- 
| '''Use Parameter'''
| A check box that indicates (if selected) that a dashboard parameter is used in the filtering condition. When this check box is selected, only active dashboard parameters are displayed in the '''Value 1''' and '''Value 2''' columns.

The settings that you need to specify depend on the widget type. When                 you add a new widget by using this dialog box, you perform two steps. In the first                 step, you select the type of the widget that you want to add to the dashboard; the                 system brings up the version of the  Add Widget  dialog box                 that is specific to the widget type. In the second step, you specify the properties                 that are specific to the selected widget type. When you modify an existing widget,                 you perform only the second step. (In this case, the system immediately brings up                 the appropriate version of the dialog box.) Add Widget Dialog Box: Step 1 When you want to add a new widget to a dashboard, you first need to select the option button         representing the type of the widget in the  Add Widget  dialog box.

(For this option, you must specify                                     both  Value 1  and  Value                                         2 .)

If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string                                 that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values                                 with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For                                 example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that                                 contains the  Customer_Name  string, the system will return all                                 the customers whose name contains any of the following strings:                                      Customer_Name ,  Customer-Name , and  Customer                                     Name . The reason that all of these strings will be returned                                 is that the underscore is used as a wildcard                             character. Use                                 Parameter A check box that indicates (if selected) that a dashboard parameter                             is used in the filtering condition. When this check box is selected,                             only active dashboard parameters are displayed in the  Value                                 1  and  Value 2  columns. Value 1 The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the                             data, if the selected condition requires a value. The value you enter                             must conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter                             or select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters.  The predefined parameters are listed in  Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters. Value 2 The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical                             condition requires a second value. (For example, the  Is Between                              logical condition requires a second value.) The value you enter must                             conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter or                             select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters. The predefined parameters are listed in  Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters. Brackets A group of closing brackets to group logical conditions. Operator The logical operator to be used between groups of logical                             conditions. ]]></column>

((({S:Hint}If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that contains the ''Customer&#95;Name'' string, the system will return all the customers whose name contains any of the following strings: ''Customer&#95;Name'', ''Customer-Name'', and ''Customer Name''. The reason that all of these strings will be returned is that the underscore is used as a wildcard character.

Does Not Equal : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     not equal to the  Value 1  value. Is Greater Than : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     is greater than the  Value 1  value. Is Greater Than or Equal To : Returns  TRUE  if the                                     field value is greater than or equal to the  Value                                         1  value. Is Less Than : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     less than the  Value 1  value. Is Less Than or Equal To : Returns  TRUE  if the                                     field value is less than or equal to the  Value                                         1  value. Is Between : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     between the  Value 1  and  Value                                         2  values. (For this option, you must specify                                     both  Value 1  and  Value                                         2 .) Contains : Returns  TRUE  if the field value (string)                                     contains the  Value 1  value. Does Not Contain : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     (string) does not contain the  Value 1                                      value. Starts With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     contains at the beginning the  Value 1                                      value. Ends With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value ends                                     with the  Value 1  value. Is Null : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     null. Is Not Null : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     not null. If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string                                 that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values                                 with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For                                 example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that                                 contains the  Customer_Name  string, the system will return all                                 the customers whose name contains any of the following strings:                                      Customer_Name ,  Customer-Name , and  Customer                                     Name . The reason that all of these strings will be returned                                 is that the underscore is used as a wildcard                             character. Use                                 Parameter A check box that indicates (if selected) that a dashboard parameter                             is used in the filtering condition. When this check box is selected,                             only active dashboard parameters are displayed in the  Value                                 1  and  Value 2  columns. Value 1 The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the                             data, if the selected condition requires a value. The value you enter                             must conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter                             or select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters.  The predefined parameters are listed in  Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters. Value 2 The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical                             condition requires a second value. (For example, the  Is Between                              logical condition requires a second value.) The value you enter must                             conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter or                             select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters. The predefined parameters are listed in  Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters. Brackets A group of closing brackets to group logical conditions. Operator The logical operator to be used between groups of logical                             conditions. ]]></column>

*''Ends With'': Returns ''TRUE'' if the field value ends with the '''Value 1''' value.
*''Is Null'': Returns ''TRUE'' if the field value is null.
*''Is Not Null'': Returns ''TRUE'' if the field value is not null.
((({S:Hint}If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that contains the ''Customer&#95;Name'' string, the system will return all the customers whose name contains any of the following strings: ''Customer&#95;Name'', ''Customer-Name'', and ''Customer Name''. The reason that all of these strings will be returned is that the underscore is used as a wildcard character.
)))
|-

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Add Widget Dialog Box for Trend Card KPI Widgets You use the  Add                 Widget  dialog box to add a widget to a dashboard and to modify an             existing widget. The settings that you need to specify depend on the widget type. When                 you add a new widget by using this dialog box, you perform two steps. In the first                 step, you select the type of the widget that you want to add to the dashboard; the                 system brings up the version of the  Add Widget  dialog box                 that is specific to the widget type. In the second step, you specify the properties                 that are specific to the selected widget type. When you modify an existing widget,                 you perform only the second step. (In this case, the system immediately brings up                 the appropriate version of the dialog box.) Add Widget Dialog Box: Step 1 When you want to add a new widget to a dashboard, you first need to select the option button         representing the type of the widget in the  Add Widget  dialog box.

Is Greater Than or Equal To : Returns  TRUE  if the                                     field value is greater than or equal to the  Value                                         1  value. Is Less Than : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     less than the  Value 1  value. Is Less Than or Equal To : Returns  TRUE  if the                                     field value is less than or equal to the  Value                                         1  value. Is Between : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     between the  Value 1  and  Value                                         2  values. (For this option, you must specify                                     both  Value 1  and  Value                                         2 .) Contains : Returns  TRUE  if the field value (string)                                     contains the  Value 1  value. Does Not Contain : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     (string) does not contain the  Value 1                                      value. Starts With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value                                     contains at the beginning the  Value 1                                      value. Ends With : Returns  TRUE  if the field value ends                                     with the  Value 1  value. Is Null : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     null. Is Not Null : Returns  TRUE  if the field value is                                     not null. If you try to filter the inquiry results by using a string                                 that contains an underscore, the result will also contain the values                                 with the same string with any symbol instead of the underscore. For                                 example, if you try to filter the inquiry by a customer name that                                 contains the  Customer_Name  string, the system will return all                                 the customers whose name contains any of the following strings:                                      Customer_Name ,  Customer-Name , and  Customer                                     Name . The reason that all of these strings will be returned                                 is that the underscore is used as a wildcard                             character. Use                                 Parameter A check box that indicates (if selected) that a dashboard parameter                             is used in the filtering condition. When this check box is selected,                             only active dashboard parameters are displayed in the  Value                                 1  and  Value 2  columns. Value 1 The value you enter for the logical condition used to filter the                             data, if the selected condition requires a value. The value you enter                             must conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter                             or select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters.  The predefined parameters are listed in  Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters. Value 2 The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical                             condition requires a second value. (For example, the  Is Between                              logical condition requires a second value.) The value you enter must                             conform with the data type of the selected property. You can enter or                             select a fixed value, one of the predefined parameters, or one of the                             dashboard parameters. The predefined parameters are listed in  Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters. Brackets A group of closing brackets to group logical conditions. Operator The logical operator to be used between groups of logical                             conditions. ]]></column>

==Filter Settings Table==
For a filter, the Filter Settings table contains clauses that make up the filter, with each row defining one clause of the filter. A filter may contain just one clause, or it may contain multiple simple clauses that you combine into one logical expression by using brackets and logical operators. The columns of the table are described below.{br}

If the filter is shared (the  Shared check box is selected for the         filter), the table is available only if the user account under which you are signed in has         access to shared filters. The table toolbar includes only standard buttons. For the list of standard buttons, see  Table Toolbar. Column Description Active A check box that you select for filter clauses that you want to be active.                 (This check box is not, however, available for ad hoc filters on reports.) As you                   enter a clause, it becomes active, with the  Active  check                   box automatically selected. To quickly modify the filter, you can clear the                      Active  check boxes for some of the clauses to exclude                   them from the filter.  Brackets A set of opening brackets that can be used to group clauses. You can use                 brackets to make a filter that spans multiple rows. Property Required. The property to be used for filtering, which you select from a list                 that includes the properties associated with the particular table or report the                 filter will be applied to. Condition Required. The logical operation to be applied to the value of the selected                 property. The available conditions depend on the selected property. Select the                 condition from the list, which may include the following options: Equals : Displays the records for which the value of the specified                     property is equal to the value in the  Value  box. Does Not Equal : Displays the records for which the value of the                     specified property is not equal to the value in the  Value                      box.

(This is a                     combination of the  Today  and  Overdue  conditions). Tomorrow  (for values of the  date  type): Displays the records for                     which the value of the specified property is equal to the day after the current                     business date. This Week  (for values of the  date  type): Displays the records                     for which the value of the specified property is within the current week. The start and end of the week are determined according to the default system locale or the locale you selected when you signed in to  Acumatica ERP. The system locales are specified and configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200550|SM200550]) System Locales (SM200550) form. Next Week  (for values of the  date  type): Displays the records                     for which the value of the specified property is within the week after the                     current week. The start and end of the week are determined according to the default system locale or the locale you selected when you signed in to  Acumatica ERP.

(The current month contains the current business date.) Value The value for the logical condition used to filter the data, if the selected                 condition requires a value. The value you enter must conform with the data type of                 the selected property. You can enter or select a fixed value or one of the                 predefined parameters (which are listed in  Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters). Value2 The second value for the logical condition, if the selected logical condition                 requires a second value (as, for example, the  Is Between  condition does). The                 value you enter must conform with the data type of the selected property. You can                 enter or select a fixed value or one of the predefined parameters (which are listed                 in  Creation of Advanced and Ad Hoc Filters).

Operator The logical operator ( And  or  Or ) to be used between clauses or                 groups of clauses. You select this operator to join the current clause with the next                 one. Use the  And  operator to find the records that meet the criteria in both                 the selected clause and the next clause. Use the  Or  operator to find the                 records that meet the criteria in either the selected clause or the next clause. You                 can apply these operators to single clauses or groups of clauses. ]]></column>
