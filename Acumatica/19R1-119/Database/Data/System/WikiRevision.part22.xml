In previous versions of Acumatica ERP, to be able to accept payments from new credit cards, a user had to first define a customer payment profile for the customer with this credit card. In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, information about a new credit card can be entered when a user processes a payment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form. This functionality is also supported on mobile devices running the Acumatica ERP mobile app.{br}

When a user needs to accept a payment from a customer&rsquo;s credit card that is not stored in the system, the system now supports the following workflow:[anchor|#_5a8c24c3-a830-4755-ab51-1dc5aba2f0a7]
#The user creates a payment or prepayment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] form.
#The user initiates the processing of a credit card payment by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Capture CC Payment''' or '''Actions''' > '''Authorize CC Payment'''.
#The system displays the form provided by the processing center, with the payment amount, payment ID, and customer address filled in.
#The user enters the new credit card data and initiates the payment.
#The system sends the payment data to the processing center.
#The system receives a response from the processing center; it then saves the transaction data, customer profile ID, and customer payment profile ID for further reference.

For details on entering new credit card information when processing a payment, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=436ed7e9-181a-4f2f-adf6-5ee022a73358|To Enter a Payment from a New Credit Card].{br}{TOC}
==Processing of Transactions Held for Review by the Processing Center==
The workflow of processing suspicious transactions has been changed. If a user enters a suspicious transaction, the system displays a warning message and assigns the ''Held for Review (Authorize)'' or ''Held for Review (Capture)'' status to this transaction, which should then be approved. Users can view these statuses on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_40_00|Cash Sales] ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]). The conditions defining which transactions should be held for review are defined in the Fraud Detection Suite of the processing center.{br}

If a credit card transaction receives the ''Held for Review (Authorize)'' or ''Held for Review (Capture)'' status, a user should go to [https://www.authorize.net/], click '''Transaction Search''' > '''Suspicious Transactions''', and approve or void the transaction.{br}

After the transaction has been processed in Authorize.Net, the user should click '''Actions''' > ''' Validate CC Payment''' on an appropriate form in Acumatica ERP. As a result, the system performs the following actions: [anchor|#_2fda9c7c-49ee-42cf-a892-988de4c5dfc4]
#Updates the processing status of the transaction on the appropriate form.
#On the '''Credit Card Processing Info''' tab of the appropriate form, adds an appropriate transaction record.
#One of the following, depending on the transaction type and whether the transaction has been approved or voided:
#*For approved capture transactions: The system will release the payment and, for a payment from a new card, will create a customer payment method and assign it to this payment.
#*For approved authorization transactions: The system will create a customer payment method for a payment from a new card and assign it to this payment.

==Changes to the Processing Centers (CA205000) Form==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form, in the Summary area, the '''Accept Payments From New Card''' check box has been added. This check box is available for the processing centers that use the Authorize.Net API plug-in. To use the new functionality to process payments from a new credit card, a user should select this check box for the processing centers that use the ''Authorize.Net API'' plug-in and that can be selected when a user processes a payment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form. ((({S:Hint}To continue using the old functionality, a user should first add a new card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_10|Customer Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303010|AR303010]) form and leave the '''Accept Payments from New Card''' check box cleared on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] form.
)))
Additionally, the '''Your Signature Key''' row has been added to the table on the '''Settings''' tab, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_ed2ee9fc-723a-4bc7-b504-80311d7c49e5][anchor|#_57a62ee2-c899-4247-9b22-a301b9f1fd44][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_New_CC_Payments_Processing_Centers.png|popup|The Processing Centers form|350px]
The value in this row is provided by Authorize.Net and is entered by a user. This value is used by the web hooks by which Acumatica ERP gets a response from the processing center.
==Changes to the Payments and Applications (AR302000) Form==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form, the '''New Card''' check box has been added to the Summary area, as shown in the screenshot below. The check box becomes available for selection when the user selects a payment method associated with credit card payments that has a processing center allowing payments from new cards.[anchor|#_138fd8ff-f1a8-45bf-b864-d9d2a30f7f2f][anchor|#_3ad0c6b0-99b3-4cb0-babe-2a1b9582a06e][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_New_CC_Payments_Payments_and_Applications.png|popup|The Payments and Applications form|450px]
The dialog box provided by the processing center, which is shown in the following screenshot, is displayed when the '''New Card''' check box is selected and the user clicks '''Actions''' > '''Authorize CC Payment''' or '''Actions''' > '''Capture CC Payment''' on the form toolbar to initiate a payment by credit card.[anchor|#_8254b2aa-991d-4981-b4e3-6c58434e1ef4][anchor|#_4114c612-5dbb-4cac-a3b2-813b594e4a08][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_New_CC_Payments_Add_Payment.png|popup|The Add Payment dialog box|300px]
When the user clicks '''Pay''' in the dialog box, the system saves the transaction data, along with the customer payment method.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] form, the '''Validate CC Payment''' menu command has been added to the '''Actions''' menu. The user clicks this menu command to synchronize the payment with its processing center transactions.
==Upgrade Notes==
After the system has been upgraded to Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the '''Accept Payments From New Card''' check box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form will be cleared by default. To use this functionality, the user needs to select the check box.((({S:Hint}If Acumatica ERP has multiple tenants, a separate processing center account must be configured for each tenant; otherwise, credit card payments from customers in different tenants may be assigned the same payment reference numbers in the same processing center account, causing data inconsistency.

In previous versions of Acumatica ERP, users could not override the shipping address in AR documents, SO invoices, and pro forma invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]), and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) forms. This limitation caused issues with taxes calculated based on the shipping address by Avalara AvaTax or another tax calculation provider.{br}

Now the default shipping address in documents (AR invoices, credit memos, debit memos, overdue charges, cash sales, SO invoices, and pro forma invoices) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]), and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) forms is copied from the location address specified for the customer location selected for this document. For reversed AR documents, the shipping address is copied from the original document and can be changed if needed. {br}

When a user is working with one of these documents that has the ''On Hold'', ''Balanced'', ''Pending Print'', or ''Pending Email'' status, the user can change values in any of the boxes in the '''Ship-To Contact''' and '''Ship-To Address''' sections of the '''Address Details''' tab of the appropriate form. To change these values, the user should select the '''Override Contact''' or''' Override Address''' check box in the respective section.{br}

When Acumatica ERP is integrated with Avalara AvaTax, the information entered on the '''Address Details''' tab will be used for tax calculation. If a user overrides the ship-to settings, the address updated by the user will be used instead.{br}{TOC}

Deferral Code lookup table Also, the system now displays only active deferral codes in the lookup tables on the following           forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=DR201510|DR201510]) Deferral Schedules (DR201510)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP301000|AP301000]) Bills and Adjustments (AP301000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP304000|AP304000]) Quick Checks (AP304000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR304000|AR304000]) Cash Sales (AR304000)  ([~/?ScreenId=DR503000|DR503000]) Release Schedules (DR503000)  ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000)  ([~/?ScreenId=DR401000|DR401000]) Deferral Schedule Summary (DR401000)  ([~/?ScreenId=DR402000|DR402000]) Deferral Transaction Summary (DR402000) The lookup table for the  Deferral Code  box on the  Deferral           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500)         and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) forms also displays only active         deferral codes, and only active codes are listed in the table on this tab. The removal of the inactive codes from these forms makes it impossible to select inactive         deferral codes, which speeds up data entry in the system. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
 Acumatica ERP now supports the requirements of the 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) standard and the IFRS 15 (International Financial Reporting Standard) and these standards&rsquo; models of recognizing revenue. If a contract exists between a seller and a buyer to transfer a package and the contract consists of multiple distinct performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices of the goods or services being provided to the customer. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligations are satisfied. If a performance obligation is satisfied over time, the related revenue is also recognized over time. If a customer receives a discount, it can in some cases be allocated to only one performance obligation or to multiple performance obligations (for example, inventory IDs) in the contract.{br}

To illustrate how revenue is recognized, consider the following example:{br}

A company sells a package consisting of three items: a software subscription license, the related support services, and upgrade services. The duration of the contract is two years and the transaction price is $1,000. The standalone selling prices for the license, support, and upgrades are $750, $500, and $250 respectively. The revenue is calculated as follows:[anchor|#_7dbfc663-4323-47bc-bedb-265e0ce730f0]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" ! Item
!width="45%" ! Calculation
!width="29%" ! Revenue
|- 
| License
| 1,000 &#42; 750 / (750 + 500 + 250)
| $500.00
|- 
| Support
| 1,000 &#42; 500 / (750 + 500 + 250)
| $333.33
|- 
| Upgrade
| 1,000 &#42; 250 / (750 + 500 + 250)
| $166.67
|}
The revenue of each item will be recognized evenly during two years—one half in the first year and the other half in the second year.{br}

For details, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=fc4d8e96-10a1-41bf-ba03-5b1576cd79b4|Recognition of Revenue from Customer Contracts].{br}{TOC}
==Reallocation Pool==
To support this functionality, the reallocation pool component of the system has been introduced. The reallocation pool is a table where the inputs and outputs of the reallocation process are stored. The reallocation process collects data about sold packages from invoice lines and splits these packages into separate performance obligations. Then for each sales order, the process collects the fair value (or best estimated) price from the list of sales prices, and allocates the transaction price among the sales orders proportionally to their standalone prices. The resulting sales orders and their amounts are used to create a deferred schedule and its components.{br}

The share of each component in the transaction price depends on the following:[anchor|#_72b30448-8b5f-4717-b2f0-be940cd50e98]
#The estimated standalone (or fair value) price
#The number of components in a package
#The quantity of packages in an invoice line

The system creates the reallocation pool only if the ''Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Algorithm for Selecting the Fair Value Price==
The system uses the following input data entered on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form to select the fair value prices used by the revenue reallocation process:[anchor|#_da830cfd-f8c8-41b8-a531-4591bbe72b6b]
*The inventory ID (performance obligation) defined by the revenue component (that is, the value in the '''Component ID''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\DR_20_15_00|Deferral Schedule] ([~/?ScreenId=DR201500|DR201500]) form.
*The unit of measure of the sales order in the pool (that is, the UOM of the revenue component)
*The document currency and the value of the '''Use Fair Value Prices in Base Currency''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\DR_10_10_00|Deferred Revenue Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=DR101000|DR101000]) form
*The date on which the price is valid (that is, the document date)
*The customer for which the price is specified
*The customer class to which the customer belongs
*The quantity
*The warehouse (for SO invoices only)

For inventory items, multiple prices with different goals may be available in the system. The system searches for prices according to the price search priority (highest to lowest) and stops the search when an applicable price for an item is found. The system uses the standard Acumatica price priorities when selecting fair value prices but with the following exceptions:[anchor|#_7a2ac1f6-c40a-42b6-bd41-14096b9281cc]
*Promotional prices are not selected.
*Default prices are not selected.
*All applicable prices must have the '''Fair Value''' check box selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.

If no applicable price is found, the system displays a warning message, and a document with a warning message cannot be released. For details on configuring packages with MDA components, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=9b33941f-6672-4049-a3a5-816a851ddcb2|To Configure a Package for IFRS 15/ASC 606]
==Changes to the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Form==
The ''Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606'' feature has been added (in the ''Deferred Revenue Management'' group of features) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. When this feature is enabled, the revenue of each component of an AR document will be recognized according to the ASC 606 standard.
==Changes to the Deferred Revenue Preferences (DR101000) Form==
The '''Use Fair Value Prices in Base Currency''' check box has been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\DR_10_10_00|Deferred Revenue Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=DR101000|DR101000]) form. This check box appears on the form if the ''Multi-Currency Accounting'' and ''Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606'' features are enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. When the check box is selected, the system searches for fair value prices to be used in revenue recognition, which are in the base currency only. If there are prices defined in the document currency, these prices are ignored.
==Changes to the Deferral Schedule (DR201500) Form==
The screenshot below shows the UI elements that have been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\DR_20_15_00|Deferral Schedule] ([~/?ScreenId=DR201500|DR201500]) form. The new UI elements are used as follows:[anchor|#_c8b1f273-058c-446e-b640-6b252b850d1b]
*The new '''Override''' check box is available when the ''Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. When a user selects the check box, the data on the '''Reallocation Pool''' tab is cleared and the data in the '''Components''' table on the '''Details''' tab becomes available for editing. When the check box is cleared, the data on the '''Reallocation Pool''' tab is recalculated according to the fair value prices, and the data in the '''Components''' table of the '''Details''' tab becomes unavailable.
*The new '''Recalculate''' button on the form toolbar is used to update the reallocation pool and component data by using the recent sales prices and the data from invoice lines. If the deferral schedule was overridden, the system displays a confirmation message before recalculation.
*The new '''Net Tran. Price''', '''Comp. Total''', and '''Comp. Deferred''' boxes have been added to the Summary area of the form.
*The system uses invoice lines to populate the values of the '''Project Task''', '''Term Start Date''', and '''Term End Date''' columns (all of which are new) in the '''Components''' table on the '''Details''' tab when the ''Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form. In this case, the '''Line Number''', '''Line Amount''', '''Project Task''', '''Term Start Date''', and '''Term End Date''' boxes in the Summary area do not appear on the form. 
[anchor|#_f5966be8-d61e-4579-b672-0498753ba211][anchor|#_4de751b6-f839-4607-9fcd-fed666b80778][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Deferral_Schedule_Details.png|popup|Changes to the Deferral Schedule form|450px]
The '''Reallocation Pool''' tab, shown in the following screenshot, has been added to the form.[anchor|#_401d91d9-279e-47eb-9e61-56d84dc36422][anchor|#_75de4ddf-7fe7-4fdc-a2ba-fc341db100b6][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Deferral_Schedule_Reallocation_Pool.png|popup|The new Reallocation Pool tab on the Deferral Schedules form|450px]
This tab contains a table with columns that represent the data model of the reallocation pool. The table rows correspond to the document in the Summary section. Users cannot delete or modify the data in the table. For manual schedules and for manually edited schedules, the table is empty.
==Changes to the Sales Prices (AR202000) form==
The '''Fair Value''' and '''Prorated''' columns have been added to the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_c22410a3-aab3-404b-b7b0-bd7af8604a91][anchor|#_305f2c16-9584-45bd-b58e-ce95d47941e7][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Fair_Value_Sales_Prices.png|popup|Fair Value and Prorated columns on Sales Prices form|450px]
When the '''Fair Value''' check box is selected for a price, the system will use the fair value price selection algorithm to determine the best available price to use as the fair value price in the revenue reallocation process. When a user clicks the '''Create Price Worksheet''' button on the form toolbar to create a new sales price worksheet, the price with the '''Fair Value''' check box selected is ignored.{br}

The '''Prorated''' column appears on the form when the ''Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606'' feature has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form; the column becomes available when the '''Fair Value''' check box for a price is selected. The value in this column is used when the system calculates the fair value price for inventory items with the deferral code of a flexible type (''Flexible by Period'', ''Prorate by Days'', or ''Flexible by Days in Period'').
==Changes to the Sales Price Worksheets (AR202010) form==
The '''Fair Value''' and '''Prorated''' check boxes have been added to the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form. {br}

When the '''Fair Value''' check box is selected, the sales prices created on release of the sales price worksheet are marked as fair value prices and will be used by the revenue reallocation process.{br}

When the '''Prorated''' check box is selected, the price will be prorated when the system calculates the fair value price for inventory items with the deferral code of a flexible type (''Flexible by Period'', ''Prorate by Days'', or ''Flexible by Days in Period''). {br}

On release of a sales price worksheet, the values of these check boxes are copied to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
==Upgrade Notes==
After the upgrade to Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, when a user enables the ''Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the system treats the deferral schedules and documents in the following way:[anchor|#_7e90d1b1-d26e-42b9-827c-ef68bfdfdcef]
*The deferral schedules and their components previously created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\DR_20_15_00|Deferral Schedule] ([~/?ScreenId=DR201500|DR201500]) form are not modified.
*The '''Use Fair Value Prices in Base Currency''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\DR_10_10_00|Deferred Revenue Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=DR101000|DR101000]) form is cleared by default.
*Neither existing documents nor deferral schedules are updated.

==UI Changes==
The following UI list describes other UI changes that have been introduced to support the capabilities of revenue recognition from customer contracts:[anchor|#_01109b29-eb6b-4ca6-ae89-3bb2a08dab17]
*On the '''Copy Prices''' dialog box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_10|Sales Price Worksheets] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) form, the '''Fair Value''' and '''Prorated''' check boxes have been added.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Finance: Recognition of Revenue from Customer Contracts  Acumatica ERP now supports the requirements of the 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers GAAP         (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) standard and the IFRS 15 (International Financial         Reporting Standard) and these standards' models of recognizing revenue. If a contract exists         between a seller and a buyer to transfer a package and the contract consists of multiple         distinct performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance         obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices of the goods or services being         provided to the customer. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligations are         satisfied. If a performance obligation is satisfied over time, the related revenue is also         recognized over time. If a customer receives a discount, it can in some cases be allocated         to only one performance obligation or to multiple performance obligations (for example,         inventory IDs) in the contract. To illustrate how revenue is recognized, consider the following example: A company sells a package consisting of three items: a software subscription license, the         related support services, and upgrade services. The duration of the contract is two years         and the transaction price is $1,000. The standalone selling prices for the license, support,         and upgrades are $750, $500, and $250 respectively. The revenue is calculated as         follows: Item Calculation Revenue License 1,000 * 750 / (750 + 500 + 250) $500.00 Support 1,000 * 500 / (750 + 500 + 250) $333.33 Upgrade 1,000 * 250 / (750 + 500 + 250) $166.67 The revenue of each item will be recognized evenly during two years—one half in the         first year and the other half in the second year. For details, see  Recognition of Revenue from Customer Contracts Recognition of Revenue from Customer Contracts. Reallocation Pool To support this functionality, the  reallocation pool  component of the system has         been introduced. The reallocation pool is a table where the inputs and outputs of the         reallocation process are stored. The reallocation process collects data about sold packages         from invoice lines and splits these packages into separate performance obligations. Then for         each sales order, the process collects the fair value (or best estimated) price from the         list of sales prices, and allocates the transaction price among the sales orders         proportionally to their standalone prices. The resulting sales orders and their amounts are         used to create a deferred schedule and its components. The share of each component in the transaction price depends on the following: The estimated standalone (or fair value) price The number of components in a package The quantity of packages in an invoice line The system creates the reallocation pool only if the  Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC           606  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)         form. Algorithm for Selecting the Fair Value Price The system uses the following input data entered on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form to select the fair value prices         used by the revenue reallocation process: The inventory ID (performance obligation) defined by the revenue component (that is, the           value in the  Component ID  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=DR201500|DR201500]) Deferral Schedule (DR201500) form. The unit of measure of the sales order in the pool (that is, the UOM of the revenue           component) The document currency and the value of the  Use Fair Value Prices in Base             Currency  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=DR101000|DR101000]) Deferred Revenue Preferences           (DR101000) form The date on which the price is valid (that is, the document date) The customer for which the price is specified The customer class to which the customer belongs The quantity The warehouse (for SO invoices only) For inventory items, multiple prices with different goals may be available in the system.         The system searches for prices according to the price search priority (highest to lowest)         and stops the search when an applicable price for an item is found. The system uses the         standard Acumatica price priorities when selecting fair value prices but with the following         exceptions: Promotional prices are not selected. Default prices are not selected. All applicable prices must have the  Fair Value  check box selected           on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form. If no applicable price is found, the system displays a warning message, and a document with         a warning message cannot be released. For details on configuring packages with MDA         components, see  To Configure a Package for IFRS 15/ASC 606 To Configure a Package for IFRS 15/ASC 606Changes to the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Form The  Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606  feature has been added (in the  Deferred           Revenue Management  group of features) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. When this feature is enabled, the         revenue of each component of an AR document will be recognized according to the ASC 606         standard. Changes to the Deferred Revenue Preferences (DR101000) Form The  Use Fair Value Prices in Base Currency  check box has been added to         the   ([~/?ScreenId=DR101000|DR101000]) Deferred Revenue Preferences (DR101000) form. This check box appears on         the form if the  Multi-Currency Accounting  and  Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC           606  features are enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features         (CS100000) form. When the check box is selected, the system searches for fair value prices         to be used in revenue recognition, which are in the base currency only. If there are prices         defined in the document currency, these prices are ignored. Changes to the Deferral Schedule (DR201500) Form The screenshot below shows the UI elements that have been added to the   ([~/?ScreenId=DR201500|DR201500]) Deferral Schedule (DR201500) form. The new UI elements are used as         follows: The new  Override  check box is available when the  Revenue             Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. When a user selects the check           box, the data on the  Reallocation Pool  tab is cleared and the data           in the  Components  table on the  Details  tab           becomes available for editing. When the check box is cleared, the data on the              Reallocation Pool  tab is recalculated according to the fair value           prices, and the data in the  Components  table of the              Details  tab becomes unavailable. The new  Recalculate  button on the form toolbar is used to update           the reallocation pool and component data by using the recent sales prices and the data           from invoice lines. If the deferral schedule was overridden, the system displays a           confirmation message before recalculation. The new  Net Tran. Price ,  Comp. Total , and              Comp. Deferred  boxes have been added to the Summary area of the           form. The system uses invoice lines to populate the values of the  Project             Task ,  Term Start Date , and  Term End             Date  columns (all of which are new) in the  Components            table on the  Details  tab when the  Revenue Recognition by IFRS             15/ASC 606  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features           form. In this case, the  Line Number ,  Line             Amount ,  Project Task ,  Term Start             Date , and  Term End Date  boxes in the Summary area do           not appear on the form.  Changes to the Deferral Schedule form The  Reallocation Pool  tab, shown in the following screenshot, has         been added to the form. The new Reallocation Pool tab on the Deferral Schedules form This tab contains a table with columns that represent the data model of the reallocation         pool. The table rows correspond to the document in the Summary section. Users cannot delete         or modify the data in the table. For manual schedules and for manually edited schedules, the         table is empty. Changes to the Sales Prices (AR202000) form The  Fair Value  and  Prorated  columns have been         added to the table on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form, as         shown in the following screenshot. Fair Value and Prorated columns on Sales Prices form When the  Fair Value  check box is selected for a price, the system         will use the fair value price selection algorithm to determine the best available price to         use as the fair value price in the revenue reallocation process. When a user clicks the            Create Price Worksheet  button on the form toolbar to create a new         sales price worksheet, the price with the  Fair Value  check box         selected is ignored. The  Prorated  column appears on the form when the  Revenue           Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606  feature has been enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form; the column becomes available when         the  Fair Value  check box for a price is selected. The value in this         column is used when the system calculates the fair value price for inventory items with the         deferral code of a flexible type ( Flexible by Period ,  Prorate by Days , or            Flexible by Days in Period ). Changes to the Sales Price Worksheets (AR202010) form The  Fair Value  and  Prorated  check boxes have         been added to the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) Sales Price Worksheets         (AR202010) form.  When the  Fair Value  check box is selected, the sales prices created         on release of the sales price worksheet are marked as fair value prices and will be used by         the revenue reallocation process. When the  Prorated  check box is selected, the price will be prorated         when the system calculates the fair value price for inventory items with the deferral code         of a flexible type ( Flexible by Period ,  Prorate by Days , or  Flexible by           Days in Period ).   On release of a sales price worksheet, the values of these check boxes are copied to the             ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form. Upgrade Notes After the upgrade to  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, when a user enables the  Revenue Recognition by IFRS 15/ASC 606  feature on the             ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the system treats the         deferral schedules and documents in the following way: The deferral schedules and their components previously created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=DR201500|DR201500]) Deferral Schedule (DR201500) form are not modified. The  Use Fair Value Prices in Base Currency  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=DR101000|DR101000]) Deferred Revenue Preferences (DR101000) form is cleared by default. Neither existing documents nor deferral schedules are updated. UI Changes The following UI list describes other UI changes that have been introduced to support the         capabilities of revenue recognition from customer contracts: On the  Copy Prices  dialog box of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202010|AR202010]) Sales Price Worksheets (AR202010) form, the  Fair             Value  and  Prorated  check boxes have been added. On the  Deferral Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) forms, the  Allocation             Method ,  Fixed Amount , and              Percentage  columns in the  Revenue             Components  table become unavailable when the  Revenue Recognition by IFRS             15/ASC 606  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features           form, and the system allows users to enter revenue components with empty values in these           columns. ]]></column>

Users can save time on data entry and reduce errors due to the synchronization betweenAcumatica ERP and credit cards registered in the Authorize.Net processing center. To implement this synchronization, a new form has been introduced: [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_60_00|Synchronize Cards] ([~/?ScreenId=CA206000|CA206000]). The system loads the data on credit cards missing in Acumatica ERP, the user selects a needed card, selects a payment method for the card, and assigns the card to a customer.{br}

The synchronization of credit cards can be used, for example, in the following cases:[anchor|#_27c1d28d-72f0-4776-8416-880a476b7d2f]
*A card has been registered in Authorize.Net, but has not yet been used in Acumatica ERP, so information on this card has not yet been entered in Acumatica ERP.
*New credit cards need to be mass-uploaded from Authorize.Net to Acumatica ERP.

For details, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=48b65c1b-a099-4624-a415-583efd1a9ea8|Credit Card Synchronization with Authorize.Net].{br}{TOC}

Although the results have not yet been imported, they are shown on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_60_00|Synchronize Cards] form, where users can work with them, saving the results as needed. The system checks for unsynchronized cards and customer profiles in the selected processing center, and auto-matches customers to processing center profiles. When the user clicks '''Process''' or '''Process All''' on the form toolbar, the system imports the cards to Acumatica ERP as customer-specific payment methods that are maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_10|Customer Payment Methods] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303010|AR303010]) form. 
*Automatically: The user can set up the system to regularly load data with new cards and customers missing in Acumatica ERP from the processing center. The system regularly loads data with new cards and customers missing in Acumatica ERP. The user can configure the scheduling of this task by clicking '''Schedules''' > '''Add''' on the form toolbar. In the '''Automation Schedules''' dialog box, which is opened, the user can specify how often the system should load data from the processing center.

After a user matches a customer to one line, if the system finds other lines with the same customer ID as defined in the processing center (the value in the '''PC Cust. ID''' column), the system displays a dialog box where the user can select other payment profiles to be assigned to this customer.

This functionality is also supported on mobile devices.
==Changes to the Processing Centers (CA205000) Form==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] ([~/?ScreenId=CA205000|CA205000]) form, the ''Authorize.Net AIM'' plug-in, which can be selected in the '''Payment Plug-in Type''' box, is no longer supported for newly added processing centers, although it continues to be used by previously configured processing centers. When the user selects the ''Authorize.Net AIM'' plug-in when creating a new processing center, and tries to save it, the system displays an error message. The other old plug-ins will still work, but the system will display a warning that the support of these plug-ins will be discontinued when the user selects an existing processing center in the '''Proc. Center ID''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_50_00|Processing Centers] form.
==Upgrade Notes==
To address the problem mentioned in the previous section with the ''Authorize.Net AIM'' plug-in no longer being supported, users must update their existing payment methods to use the ''Authorize.Net API'' plug-in instead of the ''Authorize.Net AIM'' and ''Authorize.Net CIM'' plug-ins on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CA_20_70_00|Payment Method Converter] ([~/?ScreenId=CA207000|CA207000]) form.]]></column>

In the previous versions of Acumatica ERP, companies within the same tenant could not have different fiscal year-end (FYE) dates. Now it is possible to implement multiple legal entities that have different fiscal year-end dates within the same tenant. With this functionality, an organization can accelerate implementation; simplify maintenance for companies that share vendors, stock items, and employees; run consolidated operational reports at any time; and facilitate the preparation of consolidated financial statements. For details, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=8b5e547a-7940-4e11-b986-744cf4676cb0|Multiple Calendar Support].{br}{TOC}
==Company-Specific Year Starting Date==
To give organizations the ability to use different financial calendars, the ''Multiple Calendar Support'' feature has been introduced. If the feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, users will be able to configure companies with different fiscal year-end dates within one tenant. The feature can be enabled only when the ''Centralized Period Management'' feature is disabled.{br}

With the feature enabled, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_11_00|Company Financial Calendar] ([~/?ScreenId=GL201100|GL201100]) form, a user will be able to specify the start date of the first fiscal year of a new company by selecting one of the start dates of periods from the master calendar, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_b1c74ddc-140d-4236-80b7-4d1c8e1afe8d][anchor|#_f07b95ba-41db-463f-9175-8eb7ef4b9ff8][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Shifted_Calendars_Create_First_Year.png|popup|Specifying the start date of a company&rsquo;s first fiscal year|200px]
Company calendars need to be generated separately for each company. For details of configuring company calendars, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=d187421a-630a-431c-bdd7-a9507c8c28ab|To Configure a Company Calendar]. For details on generating financial periods in company calendars, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=fac07e31-43f9-4f7f-955f-f7deb9ecc057|To Generate Periods for New Financial Years in Company Calendar].{br}

The '''Master Calendar Period ID''' column has been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\GL_20_11_00|Company Financial Calendar] ([~/?ScreenId=GL201100|GL201100]) form; see the following screenshot. The column displays the period ID in the master calendar that corresponds to the company period.[anchor|#_81a77112-abc6-4af2-b22f-b974967b10f6][anchor|#_b1abf632-0c5d-4cee-923c-b5a2a2dbc6c6][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Shifted_Calendars_Company_Financial_Calendar.png|popup|The Company Financial Calendar form|400px]
==Support of Different Calendars for Fixed Assets==
For fixed assets, a user can configure one posting book and multiple non-posting books that are shared across companies. In the posting books, the asset balance and history are stored by periods of the company to which the asset belongs, and in the non-posting books, the asset balance and history are stored by book periods.{br}

If the ''Multiple Calendar Support'' feature has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, users who work with fixed assets should note the following:[anchor|#_ec2a6f9b-a299-4c61-9d75-cce1cb5942d2]
*To transfer assets between branches of different companies, these assets should be disposed of in one company and acquired in the other company.
*If fixed asset reports are run with empty '''Company''' and '''Branch''' parameters, the data in the reports will be consolidated by period number.

For details, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=e1888694-3ffe-4208-943c-68eded1b296e|Support of Different Calendars for Fixed Assets].
==Posting Transactions for Companies with Different Calendars==
When companies with different calendars are involved in the same transaction, based on the period in the Summary area of the document, the system determines the corresponding master period and uses the periods that match the master period to post entries to the destination branches.{br}

The posting process adds inter-branch balancing entries with the period according to the calendar of the branch associated with the entry. For details, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=0e43ff39-5ad3-4d81-acf5-0e22a81212d3|Transactions for Companies with Different Calendars].{br}

Based on these enhancements, for consolidated reports and inquiries that show data posted by more than one company (with the '''Company''' and '''Branch''' boxes left blank), master periods are used in boxes where periods are selected. For details, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=3e2c3941-c8a6-445e-8253-cf18097beb2e|Consolidated Reports for Companies with Different Calendars].{br}

The '''Use Master Calendar''' check box has been added to reports and inquiries that have the company as an optional parameter and the period as a parameter. The check box determines how data is consolidated as follows: [anchor|#_31e057f6-26c6-449e-bd55-44c16c0b1da4]
*Selected: Data is consolidated by the master calendar. That is, consolidated company reports are shown for the same period of time. The reports show account balances (or transactions) posted by the master calendar. In the reports that show the Retained Earnings account, the balances of the Retained Earnings account and the Income and Expense accounts are also calculated by the master calendar.
*Cleared: Data is consolidated by the company calendar. That is, reports are consolidated by the period number. The reports show account balances (or transactions) posted to the company period with the selected number; the balances of the Retained Earnings account and the income and expense accounts are also calculated by the company calendar.

On inquiry forms, if the '''Company''' and '''Branch''' boxes are empty, this check box is selected by default. If the '''Company''' or '''Branch''' setting is specified, the check box is cleared by default.
==Master Period Support in ARM==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_60_00|Report Definitions] ([~/?ScreenId=CS206000|CS206000]) form, the '''Use Master Calendar''' and '''Request''' check boxes have been added to the '''Default Data Source Settings''' section, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_5860cf13-2c7b-452e-8b3a-8d51161abe07][anchor|#_aecc5b24-bad9-4e0e-aa77-387577ccbc01][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Shifted_Calendars_Report_Definitions.png|popup|The Use Master Calendar and Request check boxes|400px]
If the '''Request''' check box is selected, the '''Use Master Calendar''' check box is available on the ARM report parameter form, and the default value is the value specified in the report definition. If the '''Request''' check box is cleared in the report definition, the '''Use Master Calendar''' check box is hidden on the ARM report parameter form, and this value will always be copied from the report definition.
==Changes in Inventory Management==
The following changes have been made in the inventory management functionality to reflect changes in calendars:[anchor|#ul_krq_j2c_mgb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_50_00|Inventory Transaction History] ([~/?ScreenId=IN405000|IN405000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) forms, the system calculates the balances by using master periods.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_30_00|Inventory Transactions by Account] form, the following UI changes have been made:
**In the Summary area, the '''Start Date''' and '''End Date''' boxes are available only when the '''By Financial Period''' check box is cleared. When this check box is selected, the '''Start Date''' and '''End Date''' boxes are unavailable, and their values are cleared.
**In the table, the '''Beginning Balance''' and '''Ending Balance''' columns are hidden when the '''By Financial Period''' check box is cleared.
*The inventory turnover rate for an item for a period is now calculated as the quantity of the item sold during a turnover period divided by the average quantity on hand. The average quantity is calculated as a sum of on-hand quantities at the end of each last 12 periods divided by the number of periods in the last financial year, including the analyzed period.

==Upgrade Notes==
After the system has been upgraded to Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the following changes will take place in the system:[anchor|#_857fff28-81a8-409a-b1f4-909552a1702b]
*In the following tables, the upgrade scripts will set the {{TranPeriodID}} column to {{FinPeriodID}}: {{GLTran}}, {{Batch}}, {{APTran}}, {{ARTran}}, {{ARRegister}}, {{APRegister}}, {{DRScheduleDetail}}, {{DRScheduleTran}}, {{APPayment}}, {{ARPayment}}, {{APAdjust}}, {{ARAdjust}}, {{SVATConversionHist}}, {{POReceipt}}, {{PMTran}}, {{INRegister}}, {{INTran}}, {{INTranCost}}, {{INPIHeader}}, and {{INItemSiteHist}}.
*In the following tables with historical data, the upgrade scripts will update the amounts accumulated by transaction periods with the amounts accumulated by financial periods: {{GLHistory}}, {{APHistory}}, {{ARHistory}}, {{CuryAPHistory}}, {{CuryARHistory}}, {{CuryGLHistory}}, {{DRExpenseProjection}}, {{DRRevenueProjection}}, {{DRExpenseBalance}}, {{DRRevenueBalance}}, {{INItemSiteHist}}, {{INItemCostHist}}, {{INItemSalesHist}}, and {{INItemCustSalesHist}}.

Based on these enhancements, for consolidated reports and inquiries that show data posted         by more than one company (with the  Company  and            Branch  boxes left blank), master periods are used in boxes where         periods are selected. For details, see  Consolidated Reports for Companies with Different           Calendars Consolidated Reports for Companies with Different Calendars. The  Use Master Calendar  check box has been added to reports and         inquiries that have the company as an optional parameter and the period as a parameter. The         check box determines how data is consolidated as follows:  Selected: Data is consolidated by the master calendar. That is, consolidated company           reports are shown for the same period of time. The reports show account balances (or           transactions) posted by the master calendar. In the reports that show the Retained           Earnings account, the balances of the Retained Earnings account and the Income and Expense           accounts are also calculated by the master calendar. Cleared: Data is consolidated by the company calendar. That is, reports are consolidated           by the period number. The reports show account balances (or transactions) posted to the           company period with the selected number; the balances of the Retained Earnings account and           the income and expense accounts are also calculated by the company calendar. On inquiry forms, if the  Company  and  Branch          boxes are empty, this check box is selected by default. If the            Company  or  Branch  setting is specified, the         check box is cleared by default. Master Period Support in ARM On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS206000|CS206000]) Report Definitions (CS206000) form, the  Use           Master Calendar  and  Request  check boxes have been added         to the  Default Data Source Settings  section, as shown in the         following screenshot. The Use Master Calendar and Request check boxes If the  Request  check box is selected, the  Use Master           Calendar  check box is available on the ARM report parameter form, and the         default value is the value specified in the report definition. If the            Request  check box is cleared in the report definition, the            Use Master Calendar  check box is hidden on the ARM report parameter         form, and this value will always be copied from the report definition. Changes in Inventory Management The following changes have been made in the inventory management functionality to reflect         changes in calendars: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN405000|IN405000]) Inventory Transaction History (IN405000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account (IN403000) forms, the system calculates the           balances by using master periods. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN403000|IN403000]) Inventory Transactions by Account form, the following UI changes have           been made: In the Summary area, the  Start Date  and  End                 Date  boxes are available only when the  By Financial                 Period  check box is cleared. When this check box is selected, the                  Start Date  and  End Date  boxes are               unavailable, and their values are cleared. In the table, the  Beginning Balance  and  Ending                 Balance  columns are hidden when the  By Financial                 Period  check box is cleared. The inventory turnover rate for an item for a period is now calculated as the quantity           of the item sold during a turnover period divided by the average quantity on hand. The           average quantity is calculated as a sum of on-hand quantities at the end of each last 12           periods divided by the number of periods in the last financial year, including the           analyzed period. Upgrade Notes After the system has been upgraded to  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the following changes will take place in the system: In the following tables, the upgrade scripts will set the  TranPeriodID            column to  FinPeriodID :  GLTran ,  Batch ,              APTran ,  ARTran ,  ARRegister ,              APRegister ,  DRScheduleDetail ,              DRScheduleTran ,  APPayment ,  ARPayment ,              APAdjust ,  ARAdjust ,              SVATConversionHist ,  POReceipt ,            PMTran ,  INRegister ,  INTran ,              INTranCost ,  INPIHeader , and              INItemSiteHist . In the following tables with historical data, the upgrade scripts will update the           amounts accumulated by transaction periods with the amounts accumulated by financial           periods:  GLHistory ,  APHistory ,              ARHistory ,  CuryAPHistory ,              CuryARHistory ,  CuryGLHistory ,              DRExpenseProjection ,  DRRevenueProjection ,              DRExpenseBalance ,  DRRevenueBalance ,              INItemSiteHist ,  INItemCostHist ,              INItemSalesHist , and  INItemCustSalesHist . UI Changes The following list summarizes all of the UI changes have been made to support different         financial calendars: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the  Multiple             Calendar Support  feature has been added. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL201100|GL201100]) Company Financial Calendar (GL201100) form, the              Master Calendar Period ID  column has been added. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301000) form, the              Period ID  and  Master Period ID  columns           have been added to the table. The columns are hidden by default and can be made visible in           the table by using the  Column Configuration  dialog box. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS206000|CS206000]) Report Definitions (CS206000) form, the  Use             Master Calendar  and  Request  check boxes have been           added. The  Use Master Calendar  check box has been added to the following             reports:  ([~/?ScreenId=GL632000|GL632000]) Trial Balance Summary (GL632000)  ([~/?ScreenId=GL632500|GL632500]) Trial Balance Detailed (GL632500)  ([~/?ScreenId=GL633000|GL633000]) Transactions for Period (GL633000)  ([~/?ScreenId=GL633500|GL633500]) Transactions for Account (GL633500)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP632000|AP632000]) AP Balance by GL Account (AP632000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP632500|AP632500]) AP Balance by Vendor (AP632500)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP630500|AP630500]) AP Aged Period Sensitive (AP630500)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP652100|AP652100]) Vendor History Summary (AP652100)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR632000|AR632000]) AR Balance by GL Account (AR632000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR632500|AR632500]) AR Balance by Customer (AR632500)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR630500|AR630500]) AR Aged Period Sensitive (AR630500)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR652100|AR652100]) Customer History Summary (AR652100)  ([~/?ScreenId=DR630010|DR630010]) DR Balance by Account (DR630010)  ([~/?ScreenId=DR630070|DR630070]) DR Recognition by Account (DR630070)  ([~/?ScreenId=DR630015|DR630015]) DE Balance by Account (DR630015)  ([~/?ScreenId=DR630075|DR630075]) DE Recognition by Account (DR630075) The  Use Master Calendar  check box has been added to the following           inquiry forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=GL401000|GL401000]) Account Summary (GL401000)  ([~/?ScreenId=GL403000|GL403000]) Account by Subaccount (GL403000)  ([~/?ScreenId=GL402000|GL402000]) Account by Period (GL402000)   ([~/?ScreenId=GL404000|GL404000]) Account Details (GL404000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP402000|AP402000]) Vendor Details (AP402000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AP401000|AP401000]) Vendor Summary (AP401000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR402000|AR402000]) Customer Details (AR402000)  ([~/?ScreenId=AR401000|AR401000]) Customer Summary (AR401000)  ([~/?ScreenId=DR402000|DR402000]) Deferral Transaction Summary (DR402000) On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CA627000|CA627000]) Reconciliation Statement (CA627000) report, the              Cash Account  parameter is now required and the              Financial Period  parameter shows the financial periods from the           company calendar of the selected cash account. The  Company  box has been added to the   ([~/?ScreenId=FA502000|FA502000]) Calculate Depreciation (FA502000),   ([~/?ScreenId=FA507000|FA507000]) Transfer Assets (FS507000), and   ([~/?ScreenId=FA505000|FA505000]) Dispose Assets (FA505000) forms. ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, multiple changes have been made to the physical inventory (PI) process to make it clearer and more flexible.{br}{TOC}
==Inclusion of Items with a Zero Book Quantity in a PI==
In previous versions of Acumatica ERP, if during physical inventory, a user found items that had a zero book quantity in the system, the user had to add new lines to the PI document when entering count data. Now before counting is started, the user can decide whether to include items with a zero book quantity in a PI document.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form, the '''Include Items with Zero Book Quantity in PI''' check box has been added (see the following screenshot); it is available for all types of physical inventory except types with the ''Full Physical Inventory'' generation method and types with the ''By Inventory'' generation method and the ''Items Having Negative Book Qty.'' selection method for items.[anchor|#fig_sgt_prm_lgb][anchor|#image_tgt_prm_lgb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_InvMgmt_Zero_Book_Quantity.png|popup|The Include Items with Zero Book Quantity in PI check box|450px]{br}

By default, the check box is cleared. When this check box is selected, location-item pairs (from the generation method) in which items have a book quantity of zero (except lot-tracked or serial-tracked items) are added to a PI document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form if the items have been stored in the locations for the past year. For physical inventory types with the ''By Inventory'' generation method and the ''Last Count On or Before'' selection method, the system checks the date of the last physical inventory count. If the date is more than one year ago and there were item movements in a warehouse location since the last physical inventory, the location is included in the current physical inventory count.{br}

Items with a book quantity of zero included in the physical inventory are locked during the physical inventory count for all locations defined in the physical inventory type.
==Ability to Hide the Book Quantity on a PI Count==
To support &ldquo;blind counting&ldquo; (for which warehouse workers do not see quantities from the system and must enter the counted quantities), when preparing a physical inventory count, a warehouse manager can now configure the system so that the book quantity is hidden on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_10|Physical Inventory Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) form and on count sheets that are printed by using the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_62_05_00|Physical Count Sheets] ([~/?ScreenId=IN620500|IN620500]) report.{br}

To hide the '''Book Quantity''' column on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_10|Physical Inventory Count] form, the warehouse manager selects the '''Hide Book Qty. on PI Count''' check box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form (see the following screenshot).[anchor|#fig_ptg_k55_xgb][anchor|#image_qtg_k55_xgb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_InvMgmt_Hide_Book_Quantity_1.png|popup|The Hide Book Qty. on PI count check box|450px]{br}

To hide the '''Book Qty.''' column on printed count sheets, the warehouse manager selects the '''Hide Book Qty.''' check box on the '''Report Parameters''' tab of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\IN_62_05_00|Physical Count Sheets] report (as shown in the following screenshot).[anchor|#fig_dj1_mv5_xgb][anchor|#image_ej1_mv5_xgb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_InvMgmt_Hide_Book_Qty_Report.png|popup|The Hide Book Qty. check box|450px]
==Locking of Items Included in a Running PI Count==
In Version 2019 R1, changes have been made to prevent users from adding the same item to multiple physical inventory counts that are in progress.{br}

The system locks location-item pairs that are included in a physical inventory count that is in progress. Now when a user tries to run another physical inventory count that includes any locked location-item pairs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) form, an error message will be displayed and the system will not run the second count. The error message in the system trace contains the list of intersecting locations (for full physical inventory counts) or items (if at least one of the PI counts is not full). An error message with a list of items is shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#fig_vvv_ckm_ngb][anchor|#image_wvv_ckm_ngb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_InvMgmt_LockItems_2.png|The error message in the system trace|450px]{br}

Users can view the list of currently locked items by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_00|Physical Inventory Locked Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409000|IN409000]) form (shown in the following screenshot).[anchor|#fig_kfm_fvg_xgb][anchor|#image_lfm_fvg_xgb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_InvMgmt_Locked_Items_3.png|popup|The Physical Inventory Locked Items form|450px]{br}

If a user wants to run another physical inventory count, this user must exclude the intersecting location-item pairs from the count by using the '''Location Selection''' or '''Inventory Selection''' tabs on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_50_40_00|Prepare Physical Count] form, as shown in the following screenshots. On these tabs, users can select locations and items, respectively, to be excluded from a physical inventory count. (The system copies locations and items from the physical inventory type used for the PI count.)[anchor|#fig_mkw_mkn_lgb][anchor|#image_nkw_mkn_lgb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_Inv_Mgmt_Lock_Items_1.png|popup|The Location Selection tab|450px][anchor|#fig_ukp_5kn_lgb][anchor|#image_vkp_5kn_lgb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_InvMgmt_Lock_Items_2.png|popup|The Inventory Selection tab|450px]
If an item is added to the '''Excluded Inventory Items''' list on the '''Inventory Selection''' tab, that item is removed from the physical inventory count for all warehouse locations (if multiple locations are used).{br}

If a location is added to the '''Excluded Locations''' list on the '''Location Selection''' tab, the location is removed from the physical inventory count.
==Changes in the Calculation of the Book Quantity ==
In previous versions of Acumatica ERP, item quantities from inventory issues and inventory transfers within the same warehouse were included in the count when the system calculated the book quantities of items. If any physical inventory count was in progress, this could cause the incorrect calculation of items included in the count.{br}

In Version 2019 R1, the inventory issues and transfers that reflect movements of items within a warehouse are excluded from the calculation of the book quantity of an item. The formula the system now uses to calculate a book quantity is the following.{{{{PI Book Qty. = Qty. On Hand – Qty. SO Shipped
}}}}
==Changes in Cost Calculation==
The system now specifies values in the '''Unit Cost''' and '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''' columns on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form when a user clicks '''Finish Counting''' on the form toolbar. If the user changes the physical quantity while entering data, the system also updates the values in these columns.{br}

For lines with a positive variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the '''Unit Cost''' and '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''' columns according to the rules of valuation methods specified for items as follows:[anchor|#ul_cf4_cz3_ygb]
*The ''FIFO'' and ''Average'' valuation methods:
**The unit cost is calculated based on the values of the '''FIFO Default Returns Cost''' box (for the'' FIFO'' valuation method) or the '''Avg. Default Returns Cost''' box (for the ''Average'' valuation method) specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.
**If the average cost of the item is zero on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) form, the system uses the value of the '''Last Cost''' box on this form as the unit cost.
**If both the average cost and the last cost are zero on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form, the system uses the average cost on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form as the unit cost. If the average cost is zero, the system uses the last cost on the same tab as the unit cost.
*The ''Specific'' valuation method:
**The system uses the cost layer that corresponds to the item as the unit cost. If multiple cost layers exist for the item, the system uses the last created cost layer as the unit cost.
**If no cost layers exist for an item with a specific lot or serial number, the system uses the last cost specified on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form as the unit cost.
*The ''Standard'' valuation method:
**The system uses the current standard cost specified in the '''Standard Cost''' section of the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form as the unit cost.
**If the current standard cost is zero, the system uses the current standard cost on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] form as the unit cost.

For lines with a negative variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the '''Unit Cost''' and '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''' columns according to the calculation rule of the PI adjustment and uses the data of the current cost layer.{br}

The '''Update Actual Cost''' action now recalculates the values of the '''Unit Cost''', '''Estimated Ext. Variance Cost''', and '''Total Variance Cost''' columns for lines with a negative variance quantity according to the calculation rule of the PI adjustment, and the system uses the data of the current cost layer. For lines with a positive variance quantity, this action recalculates the costs if the default costs were changed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_45_00|Item Warehouse Details] form.
==Review of PI Adjustments Before Release==
When a user completes the physical inventory, the system generates PI adjustments to correct the on-hand quantities (if necessary). In previous versions, users had no ability to review these adjustments and make any needed corrections before the adjustments were released. In Version 2019 R1, the user who configures the physical inventory can specify whether to release PI adjustments automatically or allow users to review and correct adjustments before release. The '''Release PI Adjustment Automatically''' check box, shown in the following screenshot, has been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form.[anchor|#fig_p4n_qt5_lgb][anchor|#image_q4n_qt5_lgb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_InvMgmt_PI_Adjustment.png|popup|The Release PI Adjustment Automatically check box|450px]
If the '''Release PI Adjustment Automatically''' check box is cleared, the system works as follows:[anchor|#ul_wtw_njv_lgb]
*When a user clicks '''Complete PI''' on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form, a PI document has the ''In Review'' status and a PI adjustment is created with the ''Balanced'' status on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form.
*In the PI adjustment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] form, a user can edit the '''Unit Cost''' column value for particular items if the value of the '''Quantity''' column is positive. When the unit cost is changed manually and the edited adjustment is saved, the system changes the value of the '''Final Ext. Variance Cost''' column in the item line in the PI document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form.
*If a user changes a unit cost for a particular item on the '''Transaction Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] form, the new '''Manual Cost''' check box is selected automatically in the item line.
*For items with the ''FIFO'' valuation method selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form, a user can edit the value of the '''Receipt Nbr.''' column on the '''Transaction Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] form.
*A user can delete a PI adjustment before the adjustment is released. After the adjustment is deleted, the status of the PI document changes to ''Data Entering'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form, and the user can edit the PI count document and then create a new adjustment.
*When a user successfully releases a PI adjustment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] form, the system updates the values of the '''Final Ext. Variance Cost''' column in the item line in the PI document and changes the status of the PI document to ''Completed'' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form.

If the '''Release PI Adjustment Automatically''' check box is selected, the system works as it did previously: When the user completes the physical inventory, the system changes the status of the PI document to ''Completed''. It also generates a PI adjustment to correct the on-hand quantities, with unit costs copied from the PI document for each item, and releases the generated PI adjustment.
==Other Enhancements==
The following minor enhancements related to PI functionality have been introduced:[anchor|#ul_ecn_4vv_lgb]
*As mentioned in the previous section, the new ''In Review'' status is available for a PI document created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) form. This status means that the adjustment for this PI has been created and is being reviewed by accountants. When a PI document has this status, the document cannot be deleted.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) form, users can edit the following UI elements for an adjustment with the ''Balanced'' status:
**The '''Unit Cost''' column on the '''Transaction Details''' tab for items with a positive value in the '''Quantity''' column
**The '''Description''', '''External Ref.''', '''Post Period''', and '''Date''' boxes in the Summary area
*The '''Base Unit''' column has been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_10|Physical Inventory Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) forms.
*The '''Manual Cost''' check box has been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] forms. If a user edits the unit cost of an item, the system automatically selects this check box.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_00|Physical Inventory Review] form, the '''Actions''' menu button has been added with the following menu commands:
**'''Update Actual Cost''': This menu command replaces the button of the same name, which had been on the table toolbar of the '''Physical Inventory Details''' tab.
**'''Set Not Entered to Zero''': This menu command replaces the button of the same name, which had been on the table toolbar of the '''Physical Inventory Details''' tab.
**'''Set Not Entered to Skipped''': This menu command replaces the button of the same name, which had been on the table toolbar of the '''Physical Inventory Details''' tab.
**'''Cancel PI''': This menu command replaces the button of the same name, which had been on the form toolbar.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_30_00|Adjustments] form, the following references to the corresponding PI document (that is, the PI document for which the adjustment has been generated) have been added:
**In the Summary area, the '''PI Count Reference Nbr.''' box: The reference number of the corresponding PI document
**On the '''Transaction Details''' tab, the '''PI Line Number''' column: The line number of the item of the current line in the corresponding PI document
*The '''Unfreeze Stock When Counting Is Finished''' check box has been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) form. When this check box is selected, inventory items become available for warehouse operations after the counting is finished (that is, when the PI document has the ''Data Entering'' or ''In Review'' status). When the check box is selected, the system displays a warning on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_89_00|Physical Inventory Types] form because unfreezing stock items before the adjustment has been released may cause discrepancies in the quantity or cost of stock items. This check box replaces the '''Freeze Inventory When PI Count Is in Data Entry State''' check box, which has been removed from the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_40_00|Warehouses] ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Inventory Management: Enhancements to the Physical Inventory Process In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, multiple changes have been made to the physical inventory (PI) process to make it         clearer and more flexible. Inclusion of Items with a Zero Book Quantity in a PI In previous versions of  Acumatica ERP, if during physical inventory, a user found items that had a zero book quantity in         the system, the user had to add new lines to the PI document when entering count data. Now         before counting is started, the user can decide whether to include items with a zero book         quantity in a PI document. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form, the  Include           Items with Zero Book Quantity in PI  check box has been added (see the         following screenshot); it is available for all types of physical inventory except types with         the  Full Physical Inventory  generation method and types with the  By Inventory          generation method and the  Items Having Negative Book Qty.  selection method for           items. The Include Items with Zero Book Quantity in PI check box By default, the check box is cleared. When this check box is selected, location-item pairs         (from the generation method) in which items have a book quantity of zero (except lot-tracked         or serial-tracked items) are added to a PI document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) form if the items have been stored in         the locations for the past year. For physical inventory types with the  By Inventory          generation method and the  Last Count On or Before  selection method, the system checks         the date of the last physical inventory count. If the date is more than one year ago and         there were item movements in a warehouse location since the last physical inventory, the         location is included in the current physical inventory count. Items with a book quantity of zero included in the physical inventory are locked during the         physical inventory count for all locations defined in the physical inventory type. Ability to Hide the Book Quantity on a PI Count To support "blind counting" (for which warehouse workers do not see quantities from the         system and must enter the counted quantities), when preparing a physical inventory count, a         warehouse manager can now configure the system so that the book quantity is hidden on the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) Physical Inventory Count (IN305010) form and on count sheets that are         printed by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN620500|IN620500]) Physical Count Sheets (IN620500) report. To hide the  Book Quantity  column on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) Physical Inventory Count form, the warehouse manager selects the            Hide Book Qty. on PI Count  check box in the Summary area of the             ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form (see the following           screenshot). The Hide Book Qty. on PI count check box To hide the  Book Qty.  column on printed count sheets, the warehouse         manager selects the  Hide Book Qty.  check box on the  Report           Parameters  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN620500|IN620500]) Physical Count Sheets report (as         shown in the following screenshot). The Hide Book Qty. check box Locking of Items Included in a Running PI Count In Version  2019 R1, changes have been made to prevent users from adding the same item to multiple physical         inventory counts that are in progress. The system locks location-item pairs that are included in a physical inventory count that is         in progress. Now when a user tries to run another physical inventory count that includes any         locked location-item pairs on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) Prepare Physical Count (IN504000)         form, an error message will be displayed and the system will not run the second count. The         error message in the system trace contains the list of intersecting locations (for full         physical inventory counts) or items (if at least one of the PI counts is not full). An error         message with a list of items is shown in the following screenshot. The error message in the system trace Users can view the list of currently locked items by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN409000|IN409000]) Physical Inventory Locked Items (IN409000) form (shown in the following           screenshot). The Physical Inventory Locked Items form If a user wants to run another physical inventory count, this user must exclude the         intersecting location-item pairs from the count by using the  Location           Selection  or  Inventory Selection  tabs on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN504000|IN504000]) Prepare Physical Count form, as shown in the following screenshots. On         these tabs, users can select locations and items, respectively, to be excluded from a         physical inventory count. (The system copies locations and items from the physical inventory         type used for the PI count.) The Location Selection tab The Inventory Selection tab If an item is added to the  Excluded Inventory Items  list on the            Inventory Selection  tab, that item is removed from the physical         inventory count for all warehouse locations (if multiple locations are used). If a location is added to the  Excluded Locations  list on the            Location Selection  tab, the location is removed from the physical         inventory count. Changes in the Calculation of the Book Quantity  In previous versions of  Acumatica ERP, item quantities from inventory issues and inventory transfers within the same         warehouse were included in the count when the system calculated the book quantities of         items. If any physical inventory count was in progress, this could cause the incorrect         calculation of items included in the count. In Version  2019 R1, the inventory issues and transfers that reflect movements of items within a warehouse         are excluded from the calculation of the book quantity of an item. The formula the system         now uses to calculate a book quantity is the         following. PI Book Qty. = Qty. On Hand – Qty. SO Shipped Changes in Cost Calculation The system now specifies values in the  Unit Cost  and            Estimated Ext. Variance Cost  columns on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) form when a user clicks            Finish Counting  on the form toolbar. If the user changes the         physical quantity while entering data, the system also updates the values in these         columns. For lines with a positive variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the            Unit Cost  and  Estimated Ext. Variance Cost          columns according to the rules of valuation methods specified for items as follows: The  FIFO  and  Average  valuation methods: The unit cost is calculated based on the values of the  FIFO Default                 Returns Cost  box (for the  FIFO  valuation method) or the                  Avg. Default Returns Cost  box (for the  Average                valuation method) specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses               (IN204000) form. If the average cost of the item is zero on the  Price/Cost                 Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details               (IN204500) form, the system uses the value of the  Last Cost  box               on this form as the unit cost. If both the average cost and the last cost are zero on the  Price/Cost                 Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details               form, the system uses the average cost on the  Price/Cost Info                tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form as the unit               cost. If the average cost is zero, the system uses the last cost on the same tab as               the unit cost. The  Specific  valuation method: The system uses the cost layer that corresponds to the item as the unit cost. If               multiple cost layers exist for the item, the system uses the last created cost layer               as the unit cost. If no cost layers exist for an item with a specific lot or serial number, the system               uses the last cost specified on the  Price/Cost Information  tab               of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form as the unit cost. The  Standard  valuation method: The system uses the current standard cost specified in the  Standard                 Cost  section of the  Price/Cost Information  tab on               the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form as the unit cost. If the current standard cost is zero, the system uses the current standard cost on               the  Price/Cost Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items form as the unit cost. For lines with a negative variance quantity, the system calculates the values of the            Unit Cost  and  Estimated Ext. Variance Cost          columns according to the calculation rule of the PI adjustment and uses the data of the         current cost layer. The  Update Actual Cost  action now recalculates the values of the            Unit Cost ,  Estimated Ext. Variance Cost , and            Total Variance Cost  columns for lines with a negative variance         quantity according to the calculation rule of the PI adjustment, and the system uses the         data of the current cost layer. For lines with a positive variance quantity, this action         recalculates the costs if the default costs were changed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204500|IN204500]) Item Warehouse Details form. Review of PI Adjustments Before Release When a user completes the physical inventory, the system generates PI adjustments to         correct the on-hand quantities (if necessary). In previous versions, users had no ability to         review these adjustments and make any needed corrections before the adjustments were         released. In Version  2019 R1, the user who configures the physical inventory can specify whether to release PI         adjustments automatically or allow users to review and correct adjustments before release.         The  Release PI Adjustment Automatically  check box, shown in the         following screenshot, has been added to the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences         (IN101000) form. The Release PI Adjustment Automatically check box If the  Release PI Adjustment Automatically  check box is cleared, the         system works as follows: When a user clicks  Complete PI  on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) form, a PI document has the  In             Review  status and a PI adjustment is created with the  Balanced  status on the               ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments (IN303000) form. In the PI adjustment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments form, a user           can edit the  Unit Cost  column value for particular items if the           value of the  Quantity  column is positive. When the unit cost is           changed manually and the edited adjustment is saved, the system changes the value of the              Final Ext. Variance Cost  column in the item line in the PI           document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form. If a user changes a unit cost for a particular item on the  Transaction             Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments form, the           new  Manual Cost  check box is selected automatically in the item           line. For items with the  FIFO  valuation method selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form, a user can edit the value of the              Receipt Nbr.  column on the  Transaction             Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments form. A user can delete a PI adjustment before the adjustment is released. After the           adjustment is deleted, the status of the PI document changes to  Data Entering  on           the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form, and the user can edit the PI count           document and then create a new adjustment. When a user successfully releases a PI adjustment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments form, the system updates the values of the              Final Ext. Variance Cost  column in the item line in the PI           document and changes the status of the PI document to  Completed  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form. If the  Release PI Adjustment Automatically  check box is selected,         the system works as it did previously: When the user completes the physical inventory, the         system changes the status of the PI document to  Completed . It also generates a PI         adjustment to correct the on-hand quantities, with unit costs copied from the PI document         for each item, and releases the generated PI adjustment. Other Enhancements The following minor enhancements related to PI functionality have been introduced: As mentioned in the previous section, the new  In Review  status is available for a PI           document created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) form. This           status means that the adjustment for this PI has been created and is being reviewed by           accountants. When a PI document has this status, the document cannot be deleted. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments (IN303000) form, users can edit the           following UI elements for an adjustment with the  Balanced  status: The  Unit Cost  column on the  Transaction                 Details  tab for items with a positive value in the                  Quantity  column The  Description ,  External Ref. ,                  Post Period , and  Date  boxes in the               Summary area The  Base Unit  column has been added to the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305010|IN305010]) Physical Inventory Count (IN305010) and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review (IN305000) forms. The  Manual Cost  check box has been added to the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments           forms. If a user edits the unit cost of an item, the system automatically selects this           check box. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305000|IN305000]) Physical Inventory Review form, the  Actions            menu button has been added with the following menu commands: Update Actual Cost : This menu command replaces the button of               the same name, which had been on the table toolbar of the  Physical                 Inventory Details  tab. Set Not Entered to Zero : This menu command replaces the               button of the same name, which had been on the table toolbar of the                  Physical Inventory Details  tab. Set Not Entered to Skipped : This menu command replaces the               button of the same name, which had been on the table toolbar of the                  Physical Inventory Details  tab. Cancel PI : This menu command replaces the button of the same               name, which had been on the form toolbar. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN303000|IN303000]) Adjustments form, the following references to the           corresponding PI document (that is, the PI document for which the adjustment has been           generated) have been added: In the Summary area, the  PI Count Reference Nbr.  box: The               reference number of the corresponding PI document On the  Transaction Details  tab, the  PI Line                 Number  column: The line number of the item of the current line in the               corresponding PI document The  Unfreeze Stock When Counting Is Finished  check box has been added           to the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types (IN208900) form. When this check box           is selected, inventory items become available for warehouse operations after the counting           is finished (that is, when the PI document has the  Data Entering  or  In             Review  status). When the check box is selected, the system displays a warning on the               ([~/?ScreenId=IN208900|IN208900]) Physical Inventory Types form because unfreezing stock items before           the adjustment has been released may cause discrepancies in the quantity or cost of stock           items. This check box replaces the  Freeze Inventory When PI Count Is in Data             Entry State  check box, which has been removed from the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN204000|IN204000]) Warehouses (IN204000) form. ]]></column>

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_20_00|Inventory Allocation Details] ([~/?ScreenId=IN402000|IN402000]) form, the boxes of the Summary area have been redesigned (see the following screenshot). The Summary area now contains the selection criteria and boxes that display the current availability of the selected item. All other boxes have been moved to the new '''Qty by Plan Type''' tab. This tab contains the following tables: The '''Addition''' table contains plan types that could increase the item quantity in stock; the '''Deduction''' table contains plan types that could decrease the item quantity in stock.[anchor|#fig_hxg_lvy_wfb][anchor|#image_ixg_lvy_wfb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Inv_Allocation_Details.png|popup|The Inventory Allocation Details form|450px]
A plan type is an item&rsquo;s status, which reflects a combination of actions that could effect the item availability in stock and that the system will apply to the item during the next processing stage. A plan of a particular type is related to documents that contain the item and have not been released. The combination of plan types that affect the item availability in stock is defined by the availability calculation rule applied to the item.
==UI Changes on the Inventory Preferences (IN101000) Form==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form, multiple changes have been made on the '''General Settings''' tab (see the screenshot below):[anchor|#ul_wnv_xmd_ygb]

The combination of plan types that affect the item availability         in stock is defined by the availability calculation rule applied to the item. UI Changes on the Inventory Preferences (IN101000) Form On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form, multiple changes have         been made on the  General Settings  tab (see the screenshot below): The  Posting Settings  section has been placed after the              Account Settings  section. The  Release PI Adjustment Automatically  check box has been added           to the  Physical Inventory Settings  section. For details, see  Inventory Management: Enhancements to the Physical Inventory Process. The  Inventory              Operations              Settings  section has been added with configuration options that affect the           functionality of automated warehouse operations. For details, see  Order Management: Automated Warehouse Operations. The Inventory Preferences form Also, the  Reporting Settings  tab has been added (see the following         screenshot). On this tab, the list of mailings for employees is displayed. Mailings are used         to print documents or send electronic versions of documents (by email) to the company         employees who oversee inventory operations.

When a company is integrating its e-commerce system with Acumatica ERP, sales orders are imported to Acumatica ERP with the applicable payments; the payment amount is then transferred to the SO invoices created for these sales orders. Previously, accountants had to review the small discrepancies that could occur between payments and SO invoices created for these sales orders. In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the ability to process automatic write-offs for these small amounts has been introduced so that users can skip invoice verification, and mass-process invoices with small differences between the amount of the invoice and the amount of the applied payments.{br}

A new '''Auto Write-Off''' check box has been added on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_20_10_00|Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=SO201000|SO201000]) form. If this check box is selected for an order type, the system automatically calculates the write-off amount for the SO invoice created for the sales order of this type with an applied payment or multiple payments.

The amount of the automatic write-off for a particular invoice is calculated according to the limit that is specified for the applicable customer in the '''Write-Off Limit''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. If the difference between the SO invoice amount and amount of its applied payment or payments is greater than the write-off limit of the customer, the SO invoice will not be released automatically. If the difference is within the write-off limit, the system calculates the write-off amount during the creation of the SO invoice and specifies the amount in the '''Balance Write-Off''' box on the '''Applications''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_c0613465-b28c-4a67-a924-c3578a055050][anchor|#_af4bc433-54ae-4188-aa26-dff342706752][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_OrderMgmt_WriteOff_in_Invoice.png|popup|Write-off amount automatically calculated for the SO invoice|450px]
The automatically calculated write-off balance can be either positive (if the invoice amount is greater than the amount of its applied payment or payments) or negative (if the amount of applied payment or payments is greater than the invoice amount).

In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, improvements have been made in the way the system defines the ship-to information in the SO invoices, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form. The following sections describe the rules that the system now uses to determine which ship-to information is specified in the invoice, and how a user can determine that an SO invoice relates to documents with multiple ship-to addresses.{br}{TOC}
==Ship-To Information in an SO Invoice==
In an SO invoice, the system uses the following rules to specify the ship-to contact and ship-to address specified on the '''Address Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form:[anchor|#_edb1c6b8-bfb5-4423-8666-02ff241d1b97]
*In the document header, the system uses the address of the company branch as the '''From''' address, and the ship-to address of the SO invoice as the '''To''' address.
*In each document line if the SO invoice was prepared from a sales order that requires shipment, the system uses the address of the warehouse specified in the line as the '''From''' address, and the ship-to address of the shipment as the '''To''' address.
*In each document line, if the SO invoice was prepared from a sales order that does not require shipment, the system uses the address of the warehouse or branch specified in the line as the '''From''' address, and the ship-to address of the sales order as the '''To''' address.
*If the SO invoice was prepared for multiple shipments, for each line of the SO invoice, the system uses the address specified for the line in the corresponding shipment.
*In a line added to the SO invoice without a link to sales order or shipment, the system specifies the address of the company branch as the '''From''' address, and the ship-to address of the SO invoice as the '''To''' address.

When a user prepares the printed version of an SO invoice on the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\SO_64_30_00|Invoice / Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=SO643000|SO643000]) form, the system always copies the ship-to address and ship-to contact from the SO invoice. 
==Indication of Multiple Addresses in an SO Invoice==
On the '''Address Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) form, the read-only '''Multiple Ship-To Addresses''' check box has been added.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[Clients with medium or large warehouses typically use external WMS (warehouse management system) solutions for supporting standard warehouse operations with inventory items by using barcode scanners (or mobile devices with a scanning option). These warehouse operations include picking, packaging, receiving, putting away, transferring, and counting items. In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a completely new functionality for supporting automated warehouse operations has been added to the web and mobile versions of Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Changes to the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Form==
Under '''Advanced Inventory''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, the '''Automated Warehouse Operations''' check box has been added. If this check box is selected, the administrative user setting up automated warehouse operations can select any of the following check boxes, thus enabling the corresponding feature and its associated functionality:[anchor|#_7aac72ad-9583-41a5-b1fc-c001758a40bf]
*'''Fulfillment''': With this check box selected, users can perform the picking, packing, and shipping operations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form. 
*'''Receiving''': With this check box selected, users can perform the receiving and putting away operations on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form.
*'''Inventory''': With this check box selected, users can perform inventory operations (transferring, issuing, receiving, and counting items) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_20|Item Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_20|Storage Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_20|Scan and Issue] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_20|Scan and Receive] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_20|Scan and Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) forms.
*'''Cart Tracking''': With this check box selected, users can configure carts and use them in automated warehouse operations.

==Working Modes on Automated Warehouse Operations Forms==
 Acumatica ERP 2019 R1 introduces forms that have different working modes. With these modes, for the operation that the user is currently performing, the form is in the corresponding mode. Each mode of a form shows different content and supports a different set of operations. This functionality automates and simplifies warehouse operations.{br}

While a user is performing warehouse operations, the user can change the working mode on the current form or navigate from the current form to another form by using special commands (or by scanning special barcodes) starting with @. For example, if the user scans or enters <tt>@pack</tt> in the '''Scan''' box (which is on all of the forms associated with the new features and listed in the previous section), the system navigates to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form in Pack mode. When the user changes the mode of a form, the system keeps the current document selected. For example, if the user has entered the shipment number in Pick mode and has entered the command (or scans the barcode) to switch to Pack mode, the system will automatically select the current shipment. {br}

In addition to having multiple working modes, each of the forms provided by the ''Automated Warehouse Operations'' feature has the '''Scan Log''' tab, which shows a log of the data scanned or entered in the '''Scan''' box.
==Workflow Configuration==
Administrators can configure the workflow of automated operations by using the settings in the following locations:[anchor|#_c525075a-0ccc-4c08-88db-b02fb64b31a4]
*The '''Receiving Workflow''' and '''Receiving Settings''' sections on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form
*The '''Fulfilment Workflow''' and '''Fulfilment Settings''' sections on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form
*The '''Inventory Operations Settings''' section on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) form

For more information on which settings are available and how they affect the automated operation workflow, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=5e6d06dd-e1ca-4b59-bd91-b1c71c6ff393|Configuration of Warehouse Operation Workflows].
==Pick, Pack, and Ship Operations==
By using the new [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) form, users can efficiently process shipments of the ''Shipment'' and ''Receipt'' types. On this form, a user can work in any of the following working modes:[anchor|#_a68f7ef0-b947-4160-adea-6bc922910cd5]
*Pick: In this mode, the user processes the picking of the items for the shipment in the warehouse. The user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode <tt>@pick</tt>. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] form in Pick mode is shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_c28d34b9-ed18-45a5-bf5f-5d3532dc0770][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_OrderMgmt_Pick_in_Progress.png|popup|The user is picking items for a shipment|450px]
*:To start picking items, the user scans the shipment reference number from the pick list (the system downloads all line splits from the shipment) and starts to pick items. The process of picking an item includes scanning the location from which the item is taken, the inventory item barcode, and the lot or serial number barcode (if needed for the particular item). After that, the user confirms the picked line, if needed. The user can modify the quantity of the line currently being processed by using the barcode <tt>﹡qty</tt>. When all shipment lines have been picked, the user confirms the shipment (if packaging is not needed), or proceeds to Pack mode.
*:The user can remove a picked item by using the '''Remove''' button on the form toolbar or by entering the <tt>﹡remove</tt> command in the '''Scan''' box. Also, the user can use the <tt>﹡clear</tt> command or the '''Reset''' button on the form toolbar to clear the operation state and return to the first operation step of picking the items for the current shipment.
*Pack: In this mode, a user processes the packaging of the items that were picked for the shipment. A user switches to this mode on the same form by scanning the special barcode <tt>@pack</tt>. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] form in Pack mode is shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_455fa30a-a1e4-4fb0-b8d9-4a88034ab60c][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_OrderMgmt_Pack_in_Progress.png|popup|The user is packing items for a shipment|450px]
*:To start packing items, a user scans the shipment reference number from the pick list (or just switches to Pack mode if the user was previously picking the items for this shipment), scans the barcode of the box (in to which the items will be packed) and starts to package the items. The process of packaging each item includes scanning the inventory item barcode and the lot or serial number barcode (if needed for the particular item). The user performs the packaging of items until the box is completed. After that, the user confirms the box and enters the total weight of the packed box. Then the user continues with another box or multiple boxes until the complete shipment is packed. When all needed shipment lines are packed, the user confirms the shipment (if no specific shipping options have to be specified for this shipment), or proceeds to Ship mode to select the carrier and rate. 
*:The user can remove a picked item by using the '''Remove''' button on the form toolbar or by entering the <tt>﹡remove</tt> command in the '''Scan''' box. Also, the user can use the <tt>﹡reset</tt> command or the '''Reset''' button on the form toolbar to clear the operation state and return to the first operation step of packing the items for the current shipment.
*Ship: In this mode, a user can manually select shipping options. The user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode <tt>@ship</tt>. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_20_20|Pick, Pack, and Ship] form in Ship mode is shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_2a866751-abb3-4b94-964e-a236fcfc298e][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_OrderMgmt_Ship_in_Progress.png|popup|The user is selecting shipping options for a shipment|450px]
*:When the user switches to this mode, the system automatically sends requests for shipping rates to all integrated carriers that are configured in the system; these requests include the actual packages and weights of the items that are specified in the shipment. A user can review the rates proposed by carriers, select a rate from the list, receive the carrier&rsquo;s labels, and then confirm the shipment.

==Receive and Put Away Operations==
By using the new [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) form, a user can automate the receipt of items ordered through purchase orders. On this form, the user can work in any of the following modes:[anchor|#_d82bacd5-01a0-413a-ba55-daaa28077d91]
*Receive: In this mode, the user processes purchase receipts and purchase returns in the warehouse. The user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode <tt>@receive</tt>. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] form in Receive mode is shown in the following screenshot. [anchor|#_833a4750-6108-45cb-9ae7-a0e20ae2f48f][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_OrderMgmt_Receive_In_Progress.png|popup|The user is receiving the items of a purchase receipt|450px]
*:In the '''Settings''' dialog box, which is brought up when a user clicks '''User Settings''' on the form toolbar, the user can select the '''Use Single Receiving Location''' check box to specify that all the items have been received to one warehouse location. In this case, the system will ask the user to scan the location only once when the user is processing the purchase receipt. If the check box is cleared, the system will ask the receiving location for each processed item. 
*:To start processing the received items, the user scans the purchase receipt number on the printed document. The system copies all line splits from the purchase receipt and shows them as lines in the table on the '''Receive''' tab. If the user has specified that one receiving location is being used (by selecting the '''Use Single Receiving Location''' check box in the '''Settings''' dialog box), the system will ask the location before the processing of individual items. The process of receiving each item includes scanning the inventory item barcode, the lot or serial number barcode (if needed for the particular item), and the receiving location (if '''Use Single Receiving Location''' is cleared in the '''Settings''' dialog box). 
*:After all details have been specified, the user confirms the line. The user can modify the line quantity, if needed. The user can also process the receipt of items that are not in the currently selected purchase receipt; in this case, the system will inform the user that the specified quantity of items exceeds the purchase receipt quantity and will request additional confirmation to receive the extra quantity. After receiving is completed, the user releases the receipt by using the '''Release Receipt''' button on the form toolbar or by entering the <tt>﹡release﹡receipt</tt> command in the '''Scan''' box. If not all purchase receipt lines has been received in full, the user can release the purchase receipt and mark all its lines as complete by using the '''Complete PO Lines''' button on the form toolbar or by entering the <tt>﹡complete﹡polines</tt> command. 
*Put Away: In this mode, a user processes the putting away of received goods in the warehouse for a particular purchase receipt. A user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode <tt>@putaway</tt>. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_20_20|Receive and Put Away] form in Put Away mode is shown in the following screenshot. [anchor|#_30ddf12b-a928-4001-bd6a-f1e666f6f423][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_OrderMgmt_PutAway_in_Progress.png|popup|The user is putting away the items of the purchase receipt|450px]
*:The purchase receipt must be released; otherwise, it cannot be selected for putting away items. To start putting away items, the user scans the purchase receipt number on the printed form. The system copies all line splits from the purchase receipt and shows them as lines in the table on the '''Put Away''' tab. The process of putting away each item includes scanning the inventory item barcode, the lot or serial barcode (if needed for the particular item), and the location to which the items will be put away. After all details have been specified, the user confirms the line. The user can modify the line quantity, if needed. After all items have been added, the user uses the <tt>﹡release﹡transfer</tt> command or the '''Release Transfer''' button on the form toolbar to release the inventory transfer that the system generates to move items from the location defined in the purchase receipt to the location where it is put away. On the '''Transfers''' tab, the user can review the list of all transfer documents that have been prepared for the currently selected purchase receipt (see the screenshot below).[anchor|#_7ac0fe7d-ff3f-4cde-8807-53940e41877f][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_OrderMgmt_PutAway_Transfer_Details.png|popup|The user is reviewing transfer details|450px]

In both modes, the user can remove the added item by using the '''Remove''' button on the form toolbar or by entering the <tt>﹡remove</tt> command to the '''Scan''' box. Also, the user can use the <tt>﹡reset</tt> command or the '''Reset''' button on the form toolbar to clear the operation state and return to the first operation step of receiving or putting away the items for the current purchase receipt.
==Inventory Operations==
A user can automate basic inventory operations by using the following new forms: [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_20|Item Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_40_90_20|Storage Lookup] ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_20_20|Scan and Issue] ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_10_20|Scan and Receive] ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_40_20|Scan and Transfer] ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_30_50_20|Scan and Count] ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]).

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Order Management: Automated Warehouse Operations Clients with medium or large warehouses typically use external WMS       (warehouse management system) solutions for supporting standard warehouse operations with       inventory items by using barcode scanners (or mobile devices with a scanning option). These       warehouse operations include picking, packaging, receiving, putting away, transferring, and       counting items. In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a completely new functionality for supporting automated warehouse operations has been       added to the web and mobile versions of  Acumatica ERP. Changes to the Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) Form Under  Advanced Inventory  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, the  Automated Warehouse           Operations  check box has been added. If this check box is selected, the         administrative user setting up automated warehouse operations can select any of the         following check boxes, thus enabling the corresponding feature and its associated         functionality: Fulfillment : With this check box selected, users can perform the           picking, packing, and shipping operations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form.  Receiving : With this check box selected, users can perform the           receiving and putting away operations on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away           (PO302020) form. Inventory : With this check box selected, users can perform           inventory operations (transferring, issuing, receiving, and counting items) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]) Item Lookup (IN202520),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) Storage Lookup (IN409020),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) Scan and Issue (IN302020),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) Scan and Receive (IN301020),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer (IN304020), and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) Scan and Count (IN305020) forms. Cart Tracking : With this check box selected, users can configure           carts and use them in automated warehouse operations. Working Modes on Automated Warehouse Operations Forms  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1 introduces forms that have different  working modes . With these modes, for         the operation that the user is currently performing, the form is in the corresponding mode.         Each mode of a form shows different content and supports a different set of operations. This         functionality automates and simplifies warehouse operations. While a user is performing warehouse operations, the user can change the working mode on         the current form or navigate from the current form to another form by using special commands         (or by scanning special barcodes) starting with @. For example, if the user scans or enters            @pack  in the  Scan  box (which is on all of         the forms associated with the new features and listed in the previous section), the system         navigates to the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form in Pack mode.         When the user changes the mode of a form, the system keeps the current document selected.         For example, if the user has entered the shipment number in Pick mode and has entered the         command (or scans the barcode) to switch to Pack mode, the system will automatically select         the current shipment.  In addition to having multiple working modes, each of the forms provided by the            Automated Warehouse Operations  feature has the  Scan Log  tab,         which shows a log of the data scanned or entered in the  Scan  box. Workflow Configuration Administrators can configure the workflow of automated operations by using the settings in         the following locations: The  Receiving Workflow  and  Receiving             Settings  sections on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) Purchase Orders Preferences           (PO101000) form The  Fulfilment Workflow  and  Fulfilment             Settings  sections on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) Sales Orders Preferences           (SO101000) form The  Inventory Operations Settings  section on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) Inventory Preferences (IN101000) form For more information on which settings are available and how they affect the automated         operation workflow, see  Configuration of Warehouse Operation Workflows Configuration of Warehouse Operation Workflows. Pick, Pack, and Ship Operations By using the new   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship (SO302020) form, users can         efficiently process shipments of the  Shipment  and  Receipt  types. On this form,         a user can work in any of the following working modes: Pick: In this mode, the user processes the picking of the items for the shipment in the           warehouse. The user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode              @pick . The   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship form in           Pick mode is shown in the following screenshot. The user is picking items for a shipment To start picking items, the user scans the shipment reference number from the             pick list (the system downloads all line splits from the shipment) and starts to pick             items. The process of picking an item includes scanning the location from which the item             is taken, the inventory item barcode, and the lot or serial number barcode (if needed             for the particular item). After that, the user confirms the picked line, if needed. The             user can modify the quantity of the line currently being processed by using the barcode                ﹡qty . When all shipment lines have been picked, the user             confirms the shipment (if packaging is not needed), or proceeds to Pack mode. The             user can remove a picked item by using the  Remove  button on the             form toolbar or by entering the  ﹡remove  command in the                Scan  box. Also, the user can use the                ﹡clear  command or the  Reset  button on             the form toolbar to clear the operation state and return to the first operation step of             picking the items for the current shipment. Pack: In this mode, a user processes the packaging of the items that were picked for the           shipment. A user switches to this mode on the same form by scanning the special barcode              @pack . The   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship form in           Pack mode is shown in the following screenshot. The user is packing items for a shipment To start packing items, a user scans the shipment reference number from the pick             list (or just switches to Pack mode if the user was previously picking the items for             this shipment), scans the barcode of the box (in to which the items will be packed) and             starts to package the items. The process of packaging each item includes scanning the             inventory item barcode and the lot or serial number barcode (if needed for the             particular item). The user performs the packaging of items until the box is completed.             After that, the user confirms the box and enters the total weight of the packed box.             Then the user continues with another box or multiple boxes until the complete shipment             is packed. When all needed shipment lines are packed, the user confirms the shipment (if             no specific shipping options have to be specified for this shipment), or proceeds to             Ship mode to select the carrier and rate.  The user can remove a picked item by             using the  Remove  button on the form toolbar or by entering the                ﹡remove  command in the  Scan  box. Also,             the user can use the  ﹡reset  command or the                Reset  button on the form toolbar to clear the operation state             and return to the first operation step of packing the items for the current             shipment. Ship: In this mode, a user can manually select shipping options. The user switches to           this mode by scanning the special barcode  @ship . The   ([~/?ScreenId=SO302020|SO302020]) Pick, Pack, and Ship form in Ship mode is shown in the following             screenshot. The user is selecting shipping options for a shipment When the user switches to this mode, the system automatically sends requests for             shipping rates to all integrated carriers that are configured in the system; these             requests include the actual packages and weights of the items that are specified in the             shipment. A user can review the rates proposed by carriers, select a rate from the list,             receive the carrier's labels, and then confirm the shipment. Receive and Put Away Operations By using the new   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020) form, a user can         automate the receipt of items ordered through purchase orders. On this form, the user can         work in any of the following modes: Receive: In this mode, the user processes purchase receipts and purchase returns in the           warehouse. The user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode              @receive . The   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away form           in Receive mode is shown in the following screenshot.  The user is receiving the items of a purchase receipt In the  Settings  dialog box, which is brought up when a             user clicks  User Settings  on the form toolbar, the user can             select the  Use Single Receiving Location  check box to specify             that all the items have been received to one warehouse location. In this case, the             system will ask the user to scan the location only once when the user is processing the             purchase receipt. If the check box is cleared, the system will ask the receiving             location for each processed item.  To start processing the received items, the             user scans the purchase receipt number on the printed document. The system copies all             line splits from the purchase receipt and shows them as lines in the table on the                Receive  tab. If the user has specified that one receiving             location is being used (by selecting the  Use Single Receiving               Location  check box in the  Settings  dialog box), the             system will ask the location before the processing of individual items. The process of             receiving each item includes scanning the inventory item barcode, the lot or serial             number barcode (if needed for the particular item), and the receiving location (if                Use Single Receiving Location  is cleared in the                Settings  dialog box).  After all details have been             specified, the user confirms the line. The user can modify the line quantity, if needed.             The user can also process the receipt of items that are not in the currently selected             purchase receipt; in this case, the system will inform the user that the specified             quantity of items exceeds the purchase receipt quantity and will request additional             confirmation to receive the extra quantity. After receiving is completed, the user             releases the receipt by using the  Release Receipt  button on the             form toolbar or by entering the  ﹡release﹡receipt  command in the                Scan  box. If not all purchase receipt lines has been received             in full, the user can release the purchase receipt and mark all its lines as complete by             using the  Complete PO Lines  button on the form toolbar or by             entering the  ﹡complete﹡polines  command.  Put Away: In this mode, a user processes the putting away of received goods in the           warehouse for a particular purchase receipt. A user switches to this mode by scanning the           special barcode  @putaway . The   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away form in Put Away mode is shown in the following           screenshot.  The user is putting away the items of the purchase receipt The purchase receipt must be released; otherwise, it cannot be selected for             putting away items. To start putting away items, the user scans the purchase receipt             number on the printed form. The system copies all line splits from the purchase receipt             and shows them as lines in the table on the  Put Away  tab. The             process of putting away each item includes scanning the inventory item barcode, the lot             or serial barcode (if needed for the particular item), and the location to which the             items will be put away. After all details have been specified, the user confirms the             line. The user can modify the line quantity, if needed. After all items have been added,             the user uses the  ﹡release﹡transfer  command or the                Release Transfer  button on the form toolbar to release the             inventory transfer that the system generates to move items from the location defined in             the purchase receipt to the location where it is put away. On the                Transfers  tab, the user can review the list of all transfer             documents that have been prepared for the currently selected purchase receipt (see the             screenshot below). The user is reviewing transfer details In both modes, the user can remove the added item by using the            Remove  button on the form toolbar or by entering the            ﹡remove  command to the  Scan  box. Also, the         user can use the  ﹡reset  command or the  Reset          button on the form toolbar to clear the operation state and return to the first operation         step of receiving or putting away the items for the current purchase receipt. Inventory Operations A user can automate basic inventory operations by using the following new forms:   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]) Item Lookup (IN202520),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) Storage Lookup (IN409020),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) Scan and Issue (IN302020),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN301020|IN301020]) Scan and Receive (IN301020),   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer (IN304020), and   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) Scan and Count (IN305020). On these forms, the user can work in         the following modes: Item Lookup: This mode is used for quickly finding an item (for example, if the item was           unexpectedly found). A user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode              @lookup . Then the user scans the item barcode and the system shows the item           information and the inventory summary for it. The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202520|IN202520]) Item Lookup form is shown in the following screenshot.  The user is looking up an item Storage Lookup: This mode is used for getting the list of items in a particular storage           area (a location or a cart). A user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode              @storage . Then the user scans the barcodes for the warehouse and storage and           the system displays the list of inventory items in this storage. The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN409020|IN409020]) Storage Lookup form is shown in the following screenshot. The user is looking up items in storage Scan and Issue: In this mode, a user processes the issuing of an item from inventory.           The user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode  @inissue . The               ([~/?ScreenId=IN302020|IN302020]) Scan and Issue form is shown in the following screenshot.              The user is issuing an item To start issuing the items, the user scans the warehouse barcode. The process of             adding an item to the issue includes scanning the location barcode, the inventory item             barcode, and the lot or serial barcode (if needed for a particular item). After all             details have been specified, the user confirms the line. The user can modify the line             quantity, if needed. After all items have been added, the user releases the inventory             issue by clicking  Release  on the form toolbar or by entering the                ﹡release﹡issue  command in the  Scan  box. Scan and Receive: In this mode, a user processes the receipt of an item to inventory.           The user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode  @inreceipt .

The user is receiving an item to inventory To start receiving the items, the user scans the warehouse barcode. The process             of adding an item to the inventory receipt includes scanning the inventory item barcode,             the lot or serial barcode (if needed for a particular item), and the location barcode.             After all details have been specified, the user confirms the line. The user can modify             the line quantity, if needed. After all items have been added, the user releases the             inventory receipt by clicking  Release  on the form toolbar, or by             entering the  ﹡release﹡receipt  command in the  Scan  box.            Scan and Transfer: In this mode, a user processes intra-warehouse transfer operations           with items. A user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode              @intransfer . The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN304020|IN304020]) Scan and Transfer form is shown in           the following screenshot.  The user is processing an intra-warehouse transfer To start transferring the items, the user scans the warehouse barcode. The             process of adding an item to the transfer includes scanning the source location barcode,             the inventory item barcode, the lot or serial barcode (if needed for a particular item),             and the destination location barcode. After all details have been specified, the user             confirms the line. The user can modify the line quantity, if needed. After all items             have been added, the user releases the inventory transfer by using the                Release  button on the form toolbar or by entering the                ﹡release﹡transfer  command into the  Scan  box. Scan and Count: In this mode, a user counts inventory items within the physical           inventory process. A user switches to this mode by scanning the special barcode              @count . The   ([~/?ScreenId=IN305020|IN305020]) Scan and Count form is shown in the           following screenshot. The user is counting items To start counting inventory items, the user scans the reference number of the             physical inventory document. The process of counting items within physical inventory             includes scanning the location barcode, the inventory item barcode, and the lot or             serial barcode (if needed for a particular item). After all details have been specified,             the user confirms the line. The user can modify the line quantity, if needed. After all             items in the location or locations have been counted, the user confirms the entered data             by clicking  Confirm  on the form toolbar or entering the                ﹡confirm﹡document  command in the  Scan  box. In each mode, the user can remove the added item from the issue, receipt, or transfer by         using the  Remove  button on the form toolbar or by entering the            ﹡remove  command in the  Scan  box. Also, the user can use         the  ﹡reset  command or the  Reset  button on the form toolbar         to clear the operation state and return to the first operation step of issuing, receiving,         transferring, or counting the items, keeping the current inventory document (issue, receipt,         transfer, or count). Limitations The following limitations apply to the WMS functionality in  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1: The processing of lot- or serial tracked items with the  User-Enterable  issue           method specified in the assigned lot or serial class is currently not supported in Pick           and Pack modes. The processing of lot- or serial tracked items with the  When Received  assignment           method and  User-Enterable  issue method specified in the assigned lot or serial           class is currently not supported in Receive and Put Away modes. Workaround :             Select the  Auto-Generate Next Number  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN207000|IN207000]) Lot/Serial Classes (IN207000) form for the lot or serial class             assigned to the item. With this setting, the line with the item will be displayed in a             purchase receipt opened on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO302020|PO302020]) Receive and Put Away (PO302020)             form and a user will be able to override the auto-generated lot or serial number with             the correct number. The processing of non-stock items that require shipment or require receipt is currently           not supported in any of the automated modes. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the automatic creation of cases during the processing of incoming emails has been improved. In previous versions, each new case that the system created based on a processed email could be associated with only the contact whose email address matched the sender&rsquo;s email address, if such a contact existed in Acumatica ERP. Now new cases can also be associated with business accounts of the ''Customer'' type.{br}

When the system processes an incoming email, if the '''Create New Case''' check box is selected on the '''Incoming Mail Processing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]) form, the system searches the database for a customer business account with an email address that matches the sender's email address. If no such business account exists in the database, the system behaves as it did in previous versions. If such a business account exists, the system associates it with the newly created case; the case also becomes associated with a contact related to the business account if such a contact exists and the contact's email address also matches the sender's email address.{br}

Starting from Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, shipping information can be specified for an opportunity. This information is then transferred to any sales orders, invoices, and quotes created from the opportunity.{br}

The '''Shipping Info''' tab has been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_45_00|Sales Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304500|CR304500]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) forms. When a user creates an opportunity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, the system checks the availability of the following information and populates the '''Shipping Info''' tab (shown in the following screenshot) with the first data it finds, in the specified order of priority:[anchor|#_9c37723a-4a50-4275-9cc6-e28d4b60ca15]

(See the following screenshot for an example.)[anchor|#_83f0d686-cdfe-4d02-8800-da2dcc2718ef][anchor|#_eea37351-78f0-42c2-acb3-ad43ee5869e2][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Organization_Assignment_Approval_Maps_Inactive.png|popup|A deactivated rule in an assignment map|450px]
A deactivated step or rule is marked with the '''(Inactive)''' prefix in the '''Steps''' pane on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_15|Approval Maps] form or in the '''Rules''' pane on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_10|Assignment Maps] form.
==An Extra Condition for Executing a Step of an Approval Map==
If an approval map includes a large number of steps, it may be a difficult task for an administrator to configure that map with all possible variations of conditions taken into account so that an approver is always assigned to a submitted document of the specified type.{br}

In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a new setting, '''Execute Step''' (shown in the following screenshot), has been added to the '''Conditions''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_50_15|Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205015|EP205015]) form for each step of an approval map. The following options are available for this setting:[anchor|#_4a33da02-e996-443a-8312-df84b8bebe4c]
*''Always'' (default): The step is executed regardless of whether conditions in any previous step have been met and an approver has been assigned to the document.
*''If No Approvers Found at Previous Steps'': The step is executed only if all the conditions in all the previous steps have not been met and no approvers have been assigned to the document. If at least one approver has been assigned to approve the document after all the previous steps in the map have been executed, the system does not execute this step.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Organization: Improved Assignment and Approval Maps In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, assignment and approval maps have been significantly improved. Approval maps are available in the system only if the  Approval Workflow  feature         is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.

The search functionality in online Help also         takes into account the relevance of topics to the search term. If the system has been         configured to use the online Help functionality, users can get the most relevant search         results from the  Online Help Portal Online Help Portal, which is the open source of Help topics.  Configuration Setting to Use Online Help in  Acumatica ERP Searches By default, the online Help search functionality is not turned on. To turn it on, the         administrator selects the  Use Online Help System  check box on the             ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences (SM200505) form, as shown in the following         screenshot. The Use Online Help System check box on the Site Preferences form With the  Use Online Help System  check box selected, when a user         performs a search, the system searches for the topics in the  Online Help           Portal Online Help Portal and displays them on the  Help Topics  tab of the         search results. For the most relevant topic, the system displays a preview box. To determine         the most relevant topic, the system analyzes the frequency of views of the topics and         displays the one that was viewed most often. If the administrator clears the  Use Online Help System  check box,         the system uses built-in Help source for searching and does not display a preview box with         the most relevant topic. Interface of the Help Topics Tab of the Search Results When the  Use Online Help System  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) Site Preferences (SM200505) form, the search results for the Help         topics are displayed as shown in the following screenshots.  Interface of the Help Topics tab of the search results The  Open this article at Help Portal  button Topic preview box: This box displays a preview of the topic that the system has           determined is the most relevant.  The  Show Full Version  button: The user can click this button at           the bottom of the preview box to open the whole topic in a preview box. If the user clicks           the  Show Full Version  button, the preview box is enlarged and the              Open this article at Help Portal  button appears, as shown in the           second screenshot above. Feedback section: The user can leave feedback by selecting  Yes  or              No  right of  Was this helpful?  in the           preview box of the topic.  Other topics: The system displays the other topics that are relevant to the search           string. The  Open this article at Help Portal  button: This button (shown           in the second screenshot above) appears only if the user has clicked the  Show             Full Version  button in the preview box. When the user clicks this button,           the system navigates to the full version of the topic, opening the online Help in a new           browser tab. Availability of the Online Help Functionality Currently, the online Help functionality is available for only  Acumatica ERP instances in a public cloud.  ]]></column>

A company may want to personalize Acumatica ERP so that it adheres to the company&rsquo;s chosen style. This may include fitting the colors used in Acumatica ERP to the chosen colors of the company style.{br}

In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, administrators who have access to modify company site preferences can now select the primary color of the user interface. In addition to this functionality, for multi-branch companies, a different color can be specified for each branch to make it easier for employees to distinguish these branches.{br}

To give administrators the ability to specify a custom color for the user interface, the '''Primary Color''' box has been added on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]), and [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) forms. (This box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] form is shown in the screenshot below.) {br}

This functionality is available for only the ''Default'' built-in theme. The theme is specified in the '''Interface Theme''' box of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] form, as the following screenshot also shows.[anchor|#_dce16883-7d5b-403b-bd55-9da0e9d6d94d][anchor|#_8bdd9b9b-f190-41ea-bc38-6dbb64798fe0][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_Platform_Custom_Color_Site_Preferences.png|popup|The '''Primary Color''' box|450px]
The color selected in the '''Primary Color''' box is used for such elements as the header, the menu icons in the main menu, tiles, and active tabs. (Some of these elements are highlighted in the following screenshot.)[anchor|#_ef765ffb-454e-4ef5-8d49-f54d1e3c8a33][anchor|#_162ce2f4-44c5-4497-9c46-186e5d4315ce][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_Platform_Custom_Color.png|popup|Elements that have the primary color |450px]
To override the color scheme for a specific company or branch, the '''Override Colors for the Selected Company''' check box has been added to the '''Visual Appearance''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] form and the '''Override Colors for the Selected Branch''' check box has been added to the '''Visual Appearance''' tab of [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] form, as shown in the following screenshot for the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] form.[anchor|#_1f72bd96-a6df-40b9-8c2a-cb180043f2bd][anchor|#_2ca75cc6-18b6-49ab-bc93-fc05195b7d7b][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_Platform_Branches.png|popup|The '''Override Colors for the Selected Branch''' check box|450px]
==Selecting Colors for the Site==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_05_05|Site Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM200505|SM200505]) form, users can select the built-in theme (''Default'' or ''Indigo'') to apply the particular color scheme to the user interface. When users select the ''Default'' theme, the '''Primary Color''' selection box appears under the '''Interface Theme''' selection box. Users can leave the default color defined in the theme or select a different primary color to be used for the user interface. {br}

The selected color palette is applied to all companies and branches unless in the settings of a specific company or branch, an override of the site color is enabled and another color is selected. 
==Selecting Colors for the Specific Company or Branch==
An administrator with access to modify the preferences of companies can override the color scheme of the user interface for specific company or branch. If a company has no branches, the administrator overrides the setting of the site color on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] ([~/?ScreenId=CS101500|CS101500]) form. If a company has multiple branches, the administrator can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] or the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] ([~/?ScreenId=CS102000|CS102000]) form to select the needed color. The color palette selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_15_00|Companies] form for the company with multiple branches is applied to all branches of a company unless in the settings of a specific branch, an override of the site color is enabled and another color is selected. To override the color for the specific branch, administrator uses the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_20_00|Branches] form.{br}

In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the ability to easily add links to the attachments that already exist in the system has been introduced. With this new functionality, a user can also delete the links to the files. {br}

Previously, if a user wanted to use the same file in multiple documents, the user had to upload it to each document separately. This resulted in duplication of files and inefficient usage of database space. In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the user can add the link to the stored files right from the form to which the file should be attached. If the file is linked to multiple documents and a user wants to delete this file from one of them, after deletion, the file will be still available in the other documents. That is, the user deletes the link to the attachment, rather than deletes the file itself. If a link to the file is the last link to this file, it means that the file is linked to the selected document only; in this case, the user can delete the file only on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form, which can be opened right from the '''Files''' dialog box by clicking '''Edit''' button next to the name of the file which the user needs to delete. {br}{TOC}
==The '''Files''' Dialog Box ==
To give users the ability to easily add or delete the links to the files that are saved in the system, the following new buttons have been added to the '''Files''' dialog box, as shown in the following screenshot:[anchor|#_8697f083-2dff-4030-9117-9c983b27259a][anchor|#_db46b7ad-6af7-46bd-a647-831e5905a540][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Platform_FileAttachments.png|popup|The '''Files''' dialog box |450px][anchor|#_0d5d8bb7-0ec1-47b5-ad38-7eebb666b7bd]
#'''Add Link''': When a user clicks this button, the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] form opens in a pop-up window, and the user selects the needed file whose link is added to the document.
#'''Remove Link''': When a user clicks this button, the link to the file is removed from the selected document. The '''Remove Link''' button doesn&rsquo;t delete the attachment if this attachment is linked to only this document. The user needs to delete the attachment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_10|File Maintenance] form.

==The Search in Files Form==
When a user clicks the '''Add Link''' button of the '''Files''' dialog box, the system opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) form in a pop-up window with the following new buttons that can be used to add the links to the files, as shown in the screenshot below:[anchor|#_88280b6a-868b-444a-962f-2cffce62cdfe][anchor|#_608b2a83-7108-4ceb-ac62-db4e0228a3cb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Platform_FileAttachments_SearchInFiles.png|popup|The Search in Files form in a pop-up window|450px][anchor|#_f7aec8fd-44cb-4668-ab67-d651bcdcd1a1]
#'''Add Link''': When a user selects the needed file, the user clicks this button to link it to the document; the pop-up window remains open, and the user can select additional files to be linked, if needed.
#'''Add Link & Close''': When a user selects the needed file, the user clicks this button to link it to the document; the pop-up window is automatically closed by the system.

These two buttons are available only if the user opens the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] form from the '''Files''' dialog box.
==Addition of an Attachment that Exists in the System==
To add a link to a file that already exists in the system to a different document, a user should do the following: [anchor|#_68a77035-2fe1-4a41-8d38-3f7921d4db4a]
#Open the form and the document to which you want to add a link to a file.
#Do one of the following: 
#*To add a link to the file to a document, in the form title bar, click '''Files'''.
#*To add a link to the file to a document line, click the '''Files''' (
#*:[image:ReleaseNotes/Images/Attaching_files_to_record_RN.png|The Search in Files form in a pop-up window|10px]) button at the beginning of the appropriate detail row. 
#:The '''Files''' dialog box opens.
#Click the '''Add Link''' button. The [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_25_20|Search in Files] form opens in a pop-up window. 
#In the left pane, in the list of nodes, open the node with the needed file or files.
#Select the file, and on the table toolbar, click one of the following:
#*'''Add Link''': Adds a link to the file and gives you the ability to repeat this step for other files. When you finish, click '''Close'''.
#*'''Add Link & Close''': Adds a link to the file and closes the pop-up window.
#:The link to the selected file will be shown to the '''Files''' dialog box for this form or document.

==Deletion of the Link to the Attachment from the Document==
To delete a link to a file that is attached to the document, do the following:[anchor|#_813bff5b-bffe-4a3a-b9b1-ca4eee7b21c0]
#Open the form and the document from which you want to delete a file.
#Do one of the following: 
#*To delete a link to the file from a document, in the form title bar, click '''Files'''.
#*To delete a link to the file from a document line, click the '''Files''' (
#*:[image:ReleaseNotes/Images/Attaching_files_to_record_RN.png|The Search in Files form in a pop-up window|10px]) button at the beginning of the appropriate detail row. 
#:The '''Files''' dialog box opens.
#Select the file whose link you want to delete.
#On the toolbar, click the '''Remove Link''' button. The system will process this operation as follows:
#*If the file is linked to multiple documents, the system will delete the link to this file from this particular document. This will not affect other documents to which the file is linked.
#*If the file is linked to this document only, the system will display the following error: ''You can&rsquo;t delete the last link''.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Platform: Enhanced Ability to Add and Delete Attachments In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the ability to easily add  links to the attachments that already exist in the system has         been introduced. With this new functionality, a user can also delete the links to the files.  Previously, if a user wanted to use the same file in multiple documents, the user had to         upload it to each document separately. This resulted in duplication of files and inefficient         usage of database space. In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the user can add the link to the stored files right from the form to which the file         should be attached. If the file is linked to multiple documents and a user wants to delete         this file from one of them, after deletion, the file will be still available in the other         documents. That is, the user deletes the link to the attachment, rather than deletes the         file itself. If a link to the file is the last link to this file, it means that the file is         linked to the selected document only; in this case, the user can delete the file only on the             ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance form, which can be opened right from the            Files  dialog box by clicking  Edit  button         next to the name of the file which the user needs to delete.  The  Files  Dialog Box  To give users the ability to easily add or delete the links to the files that are saved in         the system, the following new buttons have been added to the  Files          dialog box, as shown in the following screenshot: The  Files  dialog box  Add Link : When a user clicks this button, the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files form opens in a pop-up window, and the user           selects the needed file whose link is added to the document. Remove Link : When a user clicks this button, the link to the file           is removed from the selected document. The  Remove Link  button           doesn't delete the attachment if this attachment is linked to only this document. The user           needs to delete the attachment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance           form. The Search in Files Form When a user clicks the  Add Link  button of the            Files  dialog box, the system opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files (SM202500) form in a pop-up window with the         following new buttons that can be used to add the links to the files, as shown in the         screenshot below: The Search in Files form in a pop-up window Add Link : When a user selects the needed file, the user clicks           this button to link it to the document; the pop-up window remains open, and the user can           select additional files to be linked, if needed. Add Link & Close : When a user selects the needed file, the           user clicks this button to link it to the document; the pop-up window is automatically           closed by the system. These two buttons are available only if the user opens the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files form from the  Files  dialog         box. Addition of an Attachment that Exists in the System To add a link to a file that already exists in the system to a different document, a user         should do the following:  Open the form and the document to which you want to add a link to a file. Do one of the following:  To add a link to the file to a document, in the form title bar, click                  Files . To add a link to the file to a document line, click the  Files                  ( ) button at the beginning of               the appropriate detail row.  The  Files  dialog box opens. Click the  Add Link  button. The   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202520|SM202520]) Search in Files form opens in a pop-up window.  In the left pane, in the list of nodes, open the node with the needed file or           files. Select the file, and on the table toolbar, click one of the following: Add Link : Adds a link to the file and gives you the ability               to repeat this step for other files. When you finish, click                  Close . Add Link & Close : Adds a link to the file and closes the               pop-up window. The link to the selected file will be shown to the  Files              dialog box for this form or document. Deletion of the Link to the Attachment from the Document To delete a link to a file that is attached to the document, do the following: Open the form and the document from which you want to delete a file. Do one of the following:  To delete a link to the file from a document, in the form title bar, click                  Files . To delete a link to the file from a document line, click the                  Files  ( ) button at the beginning of               the appropriate detail row.  The  Files  dialog box opens. Select the file whose link you want to delete. On the toolbar, click the  Remove Link  button. The system will process           this operation as follows: If the file is linked to multiple documents, the system will delete the link to this               file from this particular document. This will not affect other documents to which the               file is linked. If the file is linked to this document only, the system will display the following               error:  You can't delete the last link . To delete the file from the system               entirely, in the  Files  dialog box, next to the file name, click                  Edit , and on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM202510|SM202510]) File Maintenance               form, which opens, click  Delete . This will permanently delete               the file from the system. ]]></column>

*The usability of the clickable areas in the fields and icons of the pivot table view screen has been improved. The icons are now highlighted when a user points at them, so that it is easier to see if the user is clicking the '''Sort''' or '''Filter''' icon.
*In the pivot table view mode, users can no longer drag the fields between rows and columns. The movement of fields to different rows and columns can now be made only on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_10|Pivot Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208010|SM208010]) form.

==Changes on the Users form==
The '''Location Tracking''' tab, where an administrator can configure location tracking for a particular user, has been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form. The tab contains the following elements (see the screenshot below):[anchor|#_501c90a3-1e85-4c8e-8adf-37f06c8a6bfa]
*The '''Track Location''' check box, which can be selected to turn on location tracking for the user selected on the form
*The '''Tracking Frequency In''' ''x'' '''Minutes''' box, in which the administrator can specify how often the mobile device registers the user location
*The '''Distance Frequency In''' ''x'' '''Meters''' box, in which the administrator can specify the distance that the user has to move so that the mobile device registers the user location
*The table in the bottom of the section, in which the administrator can specify on which days and in which time periods the mobile registers the user location. The table contains the following columns:
**'''Days of Week''': The day of the week on which the location is tracked.
**'''Start Time''': The time when the location tracking starts for the particular day of the week.
**'''End Time''': The time when the location tracking ends for the particular day of the week.

In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, two-factor authentication has been introduced, whereby a user is granted access only after the user successfully presents to the system additional evidence of authentication in addition to the user credentials (that is, the username and password). At the system level, a system administrator can require two-factor authentication or turn off this authentication (the default setting). In addition, the administrator can specify different settings for individual users with regard to two-factor authentication; user settings take precedence over system-wide settings.{br}

If two-factor authentication is required, the user needs to authenticate the sign-in operation by using one of the methods displayed on the following screenshot.[anchor|#_c0b67561-4712-4c43-ae6b-30f6ef26b09e][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_TwoFactor_2.png|popup|250px]{br}

By default, when two-factor authentication is enabled, the system uses the push notification method to authenticate the login operation.((({S:Hint}Push notifications are available for only instances with a valid license.
))){br}

The push notification method of authentication requires the Acumatica ERP application to be set up on a mobile device.[anchor|#_386f2e44-3f7d-4d17-8308-64932c38f53f][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_TwoFactor_1.png|popup|250px]{br}

It is possible to specify whether the user confirms authentication in the following ways:[anchor|#_9658494d-2d2f-472c-ab92-fe59f1e01c69]
*By tapping '''Approve''' in mobile application push-notification
*By Email (this authentication method will be in the list if the administrator selects the ''Allow Email'' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form)
*Via SMS (this authentication method will be in the list if the administrator selects the ''Allow SMS'' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form)
*By generating codes in Acumatica ERP mobile application with the <tt>Generate Access Code</tt> command
*By generating codes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) or User Profile (SM203010) form
{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form, the '''Two-Factor Authentication Policy''' section has been added. In the '''Two-Factor Authentication''' box, the administrator can select ''None'' (two-factor authentication is not in use in the system), ''Required'' (two-factor authentication is required system-wide) or ''Required for Unknown Devices'' (two-factor authentication is only required for the unknown devices.). If the administrator selects the '''Allow Email''' check box, the authentication can be performed by using the email address specified for a user. ((({S:Hint}On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form, when the ''Required for the Unknown Devices'' option is selected in the '''Two-Factor Authentication''' box, the '''Do not Request Confirmation on This Device Again''' check box will become visible on the login screen. This box allows the user to disable the second authentication step after a successful login of the used device.
)))((({S:Hint}If the administrator selects the '''Allow SMS''' box, which does not appear on this form by default, authentication via SMS can be used. Authentication via SMS and the '''Allow SMS''' check box can be enabled after the administrator downloads the additional customization posted at ''https://portal.acumatica.com''. The user will also need to set up the SMS provider on the ''Voice Provider (SM203535)'' form to use the SMS authentication method.
)))
The two-factor authentication settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form influence all the company's users that do not have their own setting specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form, the '''Two-Factor Authentication''' section has been added. The administrator must select the new '''Override Security Preferences''' check box in order to override the system default setting in the '''Two-Factor Authentication''' box and specify the two-factor authentication mode for the selected user. (Otherwise, the settings specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form will be used.){br}

The '''Send Confirmation Push''' column has been added to the '''Devices''' tab of the [https://help-2018r2.acumatica.com/(W(5))/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=834cc181-97fa-4db4-a7e0-3eaba142c166|Users] form. The column indicates whether the push notification login request will be sent to each particular device when the user tries to sign in to the web application.{br}

On the User Profile and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form, the '''Generate Access Codes''' button has been added to the form toolbar. The administrator clicks this button to generate and display a list of access codes for the selected user.{br}

If two-factor authentication is required for a particular user, the first time that user signs in to the Acumatica ERP mobile app, the system will request the security access code that will be sent to the user&rsquo;s email address on signing in to the web version of Acumatica ERP. The mobile app will also require PIN code or biometric verification when the user signs in. The new '''Generate Access Code''' command in the account editing menu of the mobile app allows the user to generate access codes for two-factor authentication.{br}{TOC}
==Configuring Two-Factor Authentication==
Before enabling two-factor authentication users must do the following preparations steps:[anchor|#ol_d5t_rdp_4gb]
#Make sure that all users have email addresses properly configured in the system, and an action of sending and receiving emails by schedule is activated. You will receive access code by email for the first sign in after two-factor authentication is enabled.
#Be sure that your license is activated for the instance. Otherwise two-factor authentication by push notifications cannot be used.
#If your site works via the HTTP protocol add the following key to the ''web.config'' file: <tt>&lt;add key=&ldquo;identityServer:allowHttp&ldquo; value=&ldquo;true&ldquo; /&gt;</tt>

Users do the following to configure two-factor authentication:[anchor|#ol_e5t_rdp_4gb]
#If you want to enable two-factor authentication for all users, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form, in the '''Two-Factor Authentication''' box, select ''Required''.
#If you want to enable two-factor authentication for a particular user do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form:
##In the '''Login''' box of the Summary area, select a user for whom you want to enable the two-factor authentication
##Select the '''Override Security Preferences''' check box.
##In the '''Two-Factor Authentication''' box, select ''Required''.
##:((({S:Hint}If two-factor authentication is enabled for a user at least in one tenant the user must sign in to all tenants (to which he or she has access) by using two-factor authentication.
)))
#Before you sign out the system, generate access codes for at least a user with a system administrator role as follows: On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] or User Profile form, click '''Generate Access Codes''' for each user. The system will generate access codes that the user can use if other sign-in ways will not work. Then print or save the list of codes for the future use.
#If you want the system to send access codes by email, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form, in the '''Two-Factor Authentication Policy''' section, select the '''Allow Email''' check box. When a user with two-factor authentication enabled signs in to the system, an access code will be sent at an email specified for the user on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] form.
#If you want the system to send access codes by SMS do the following:
##Publish the <tt>PXVoiceProvider.zip</tt> customization (which you can download from the Partner Portal).
##On the Voice Providers form, set up parameters of the ''Twilio'' account.
##On the Security Preferences form, select the '''Allow SMS''' check box in the '''Two-Factor Authentication Policy''' section. When a user with two-factor authentication enabled signs in to the system, an access code will be sent at a mobile phone number specified for the user on the User Profile form.

==Signing In with Two-Factor Authentication==
When two-factor authentication has been enabled, users must register their mobile devices to receive confirmation requests as push notifications. That is, each user must sign it to the Acumatica ERP server in the mobile application by using an access code.((({S:Hint}Even if users signed in to the server before, they must sign in again by using an access code. This must be done once for each mobile device.
)))
To register a mobile device, users do the following:[anchor|#ol_k5t_rdp_4gb]
#When a user enters credentials on the Welcome page, the system sends an access code for a mobile application to the user&rsquo;s email.
#A user does the following on his or her mobile device:
##If the Acumatica ERP mobile application is not installed on the device, the user installs the application and creates an account for the Acumatica ERP server to which he or she wants to connect.
##When the user signs in to the account and enters credentials the mobile application requests an access code. The user enters the access code received by email (see the following screenshot). If the access code is not received the user can use an access code from the list generated on the [https://help-2018r2.acumatica.com/(W(5))/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=834cc181-97fa-4db4-a7e0-3eaba142c166|Users] or User Profile form.[anchor|#image_akc_p5p_4gb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_TwoFactor_Auth_1.png|popup|A sample email with an access code|450px]
#When the user sign in to the mobile application, he or she clicks the '''Send request to device''' button on the Welcome page (as shown in the following screenshot). The system will send a push notification to the registered device and display a code that the push notification will contain. If the message with the access code is not displayed on the Welcome page this means that the device was not registered properly, and a user must make sure that instructions in the previous step have been completed correctly.[anchor|#image_n1v_w5p_4gb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_TwoFactor_Auth_2.png|popup|The Send request to device button|450px]
#The user opens the push notification and tap '''Approve''' (as shown in the following screenshot). The user will need to confirm approval by biometric authentication (if it supported by device) or by entering PIN to the device.[anchor|#image_otz_2vp_4gb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_TwoFactor_Auth_3.png|popup|A sample push notification with an access code|200px]
#The user will be signed in to the web application automatically.

If a user cannot receive a push notification he or she can use the ''Use Another Authentication Method'' link on the Welcome page. The user can use any of the following authentication methods:[anchor|#ol_t5t_rdp_4gb]
*Receive an access code by SMS: A user can use this method if sending SMS has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) form and the correct mobile phone number is specified on the User Profile form. When the user receives the access code in SMS he or she enters the code on the Welcome page.
*Receive an access code by email: A user can use this method if sending emails has been enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_60|Security Preferences] form and the correct email is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) form. When the user receives the access code in email he or she enters the code on the Welcome page.
*Use an existing access code or a code generated by the mobile application: The user can use one of codes from the list generated on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] or User profile form. Alternatively, if the user is signed in the mobile application he or she can use the '''Generate Access Code''' action on the mobile device (see the following screenshot).[anchor|#image_ihj_cxp_4gb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_TwoFactor_Auth_4.png|popup|The Generate Access Code action in the mobile application|300px]

When a user signs in to the system after registration a push notification with a sign-in request will be sent automatically on the user&rsquo;s registered mobile devices. The user must approve the request, and sign-in will be performed automatically. The other authentication methods (which are described above) also can be used if push notifications are not available at the moment of sign-in.{br}

When a user signs in to the mobile application by using an account with enabled two-factor authentication the application will always request to confirm the user&rsquo;s identity by biometric authentication (if it is supported by the device) or by entering PIN.{br}

Push notifications with sign-in requests can be disabled for particular device or devices by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_10_10|Users] or User Profile form as follows: On the '''Devices''' tab, clear the check box in the '''Send Confirmation Push''' column.]]></column>

It is possible to specify whether the user confirms authentication in the following           ways: By tapping  Approve  in mobile application push-notification By Email (this authentication method will be in the list if the administrator selects             the  Allow Email  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences Security Preferences (SM201060) form) Via SMS (this authentication method will be in the list if the administrator selects             the  Allow SMS  check box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences Security Preferences form) By generating codes in  Acumatica ERP mobile application with the  Generate Access Code  command By generating codes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users Users (SM201010) or User Profile (SM203010) form On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security           Preferences Security Preferences form, the  Two-Factor Authentication Policy          section has been added. In the  Two-Factor Authentication  box, the         administrator can select  None  (two-factor authentication is not in use in the         system),  Required  (two-factor authentication is required system-wide) or  Required           for Unknown Devices  (two-factor authentication is only required for the unknown         devices.). If the administrator selects the  Allow Email  check box,         the authentication can be performed by using the email address specified for a user.  On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences Security Preferences form, when the  Required for the Unknown Devices  option         is selected in the  Two-Factor Authentication  box, the  Do           not Request Confirmation on This Device Again  check box will become visible on         the login screen. This box allows the user to disable the second authentication step after a         successful login of the used device. If the administrator selects the  Allow SMS  box, which does not         appear on this form by default, authentication via SMS can be used. Authentication via SMS         and the  Allow SMS  check box can be enabled after the administrator         downloads the additional customization posted at  https://portal.acumatica.com . The         user will also need to set up the SMS provider on the  Voice Provider (SM203535)  form         to use the SMS authentication method. The two-factor authentication settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences Security Preferences form influence all the         company's users that do not have their own setting specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users Users         (SM201010) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users Users form, the  Two-Factor Authentication  section has been         added. The administrator must select the new  Override Security           Preferences  check box in order to override the system default setting in the            Two-Factor Authentication  box and specify the two-factor         authentication mode for the selected user. (Otherwise, the settings specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security           Preferences Security Preferences form will be used.) The  Send Confirmation Push  column has been added to the            Devices  tab of the  Users Users form. The column indicates whether the push         notification login request will be sent to each particular device when the user tries to         sign in to the web application. On the User Profile and   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users Users form, the  Generate Access Codes          button has been added to the form toolbar. The administrator clicks this button to generate         and display a list of access codes for the selected user. If two-factor authentication is required for a particular user, the first time that user         signs in to the  Acumatica ERP mobile app, the system will request the security access code that will be sent to the         user's email address on signing in to the web version of  Acumatica ERP. The mobile app will also require PIN code or biometric verification when the user signs         in. The new  Generate Access Code  command in the account editing menu         of the mobile app allows the user to generate access codes for two-factor         authentication. Configuring Two-Factor Authentication Before enabling two-factor authentication users must do the following preparations         steps: Make sure that all users have email addresses properly configured in the system, and an           action of sending and receiving emails by schedule is activated. You will receive access           code by email for the first sign in after two-factor authentication is enabled. Be sure that your license is activated for the instance. Otherwise two-factor           authentication by push notifications cannot be used. If your site works via the HTTP protocol add the following key to the  web.config            file:  <add key="identityServer:allowHttp" value="true" /> Users do the following to configure two-factor authentication: If you want to enable two-factor authentication for all users, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security             Preferences Security Preferences (SM201060) form, in the  Two-Factor             Authentication  box, select  Required . If you want to enable two-factor authentication for a particular user do the following           on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users Users (SM201010) form: In the  Login  box of the Summary area, select a user for whom               you want to enable the two-factor authentication Select the  Override Security Preferences  check box. In the  Two-Factor Authentication  box, select                  Required . If two-factor authentication is enabled for a user at least in                 one tenant the user must sign in to all tenants (to which he or she has access) by                 using two-factor authentication. Before you sign out the system, generate access codes for at least a user with a system           administrator role as follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users Users or User Profile form, click              Generate Access Codes  for each user. The system will generate           access codes that the user can use if other sign-in ways will not work. Then print or save           the list of codes for the future use. If you want the system to send access codes by email, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security             Preferences Security Preferences form, in the  Two-Factor Authentication Policy            section, select the  Allow Email  check box. When a user with           two-factor authentication enabled signs in to the system, an access code will be sent at           an email specified for the user on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users Users form. If you want the system to send access codes by SMS do the following: Publish the  PXVoiceProvider.zip  customization (which you can download from               the Partner Portal). On the Voice Providers form, set up parameters of the  Twilio  account. On the Security Preferences form, select the  Allow SMS  check               box in the  Two-Factor Authentication Policy  section. When a               user with two-factor authentication enabled signs in to the system, an access code               will be sent at a mobile phone number specified for the user on the User Profile               form. Signing In with Two-Factor Authentication When two-factor authentication has been enabled, users must register their mobile devices         to receive confirmation requests as push notifications. That is, each user must sign it to         the  Acumatica ERP server in the mobile application by using an access code. Even if users signed in to the server before, they must sign in again by using an access         code. This must be done once for each mobile device. To register a mobile device, users do the following: When a user enters credentials on the Welcome page, the system sends an access code for           a mobile application to the user's email. A user does the following on his or her mobile device: If the  Acumatica ERP mobile application is not installed on the device, the user installs the               application and creates an account for the  Acumatica ERP server to which he or she wants to connect. When the user signs in to the account and enters credentials the mobile application               requests an access code. The user enters the access code received by email (see the               following screenshot). If the access code is not received the user can use an access               code from the list generated on the  Users Users or User Profile form. A sample email with an access code When the user sign in to the mobile application, he or she clicks the  Send             request to device  button on the Welcome page (as shown in the following           screenshot). The system will send a push notification to the registered device and display           a code that the push notification will contain. If the message with the access code is not           displayed on the Welcome page this means that the device was not registered properly, and           a user must make sure that instructions in the previous step have been completed             correctly. The Send request to device button The user opens the push notification and tap  Approve  (as shown in           the following screenshot). The user will need to confirm approval by biometric           authentication (if it supported by device) or by entering PIN to the device. A sample push notification with an access code The user will be signed in to the web application automatically. If a user cannot receive a push notification he or she can use the  Use Another           Authentication Method  link on the Welcome page. The user can use any of the following         authentication methods: Receive an access code by SMS: A user can use this method if sending SMS has been           enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences Security Preferences (SM201060) form and the correct mobile phone number is           specified on the User Profile form. When the user receives the access code in SMS he or           she enters the code on the Welcome page. Receive an access code by email: A user can use this method if sending emails has been           enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201060|SM201060]) Security Preferences Security Preferences form and the correct email is specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users Users           (SM201010) form. When the user receives the access code in email he or she enters the code           on the Welcome page. Use an existing access code or a code generated by the mobile application: The user can           use one of codes from the list generated on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users Users or User profile form. Alternatively, if the           user is signed in the mobile application he or she can use the  Generate Access             Code  action on the mobile device (see the following screenshot). The Generate Access Code action in the mobile application When a user signs in to the system after registration a push notification with a sign-in         request will be sent automatically on the user's registered mobile devices. The user must         approve the request, and sign-in will be performed automatically. The other authentication         methods (which are described above) also can be used if push notifications are not available         at the moment of sign-in. When a user signs in to the mobile application by using an account with enabled two-factor         authentication the application will always request to confirm the user's identity by         biometric authentication (if it is supported by the device) or by entering PIN. Push notifications with sign-in requests can be disabled for particular device or devices         by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM201010|SM201010]) Users Users or User Profile form as follows: On the  Devices  tab,         clear the check box in the  Send Confirmation Push  column. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a new ''Budget Forecast'' feature has been introduced. The feature makes the new [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form available. On this form, users can enter and modify project budget forecasts and compare these forecasts with the actual project costs and incomes for each financial period.{br}

On the form, users can forecast original and revised budget amounts and quantities for existing project budget lines for financial periods of the master calendar. Each project can have multiple budget forecast revisions. In a forecast revision, a user can distribute amounts and quantities of the project budget among the selected range of financial periods to speed data entry. By using forecast data, users can create generic inquiries and pivot tables.{br}

Before users can start using the budget forecasting functionality, an administrative user enables the ''Budget Forecast'' feature on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}{TOC}[anchor|#section_fdf_x42_p2b]
==Creation of the Project Budget Forecast==
A user can create a project budget forecast on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form.{br}

For a new project budget forecast, in the Summary area of this form, the user selects a project and enters an alphanumeric revision identifier of the budget forecast, which must be unique within the project. When a user enters the revision, the system automatically fills in the table with the budget lines of the selected project, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#fig_qlg_pbr_r2b][anchor|#image_rlg_pbr_r2b][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Project_Budget_Forecast1.png|popup|A new revision of the project budget forecast|400px]
In the Summary area, the user can also specify any of the following selection criteria to view in the table only the project budget lines with the selected settings:[anchor|#ul_fsf_yfs_p2b]
*'''Project Task''': The applicable project task of the selected project
*'''Type''': The account group type of the budget line, which is ''Expense'' by default
*'''Account Group''': The account group of the budget line
*'''Inventory ID''': The applicable stock or non-stock inventory item
*'''Cost Code''': The applicable cost code if the ''Cost Codes'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, a user can also create a new revision of the project budget forecast as a copy of an existing revision of the project budget forecast and modify this copy.[anchor|#section_xv2_f1w_mcb]
==Distribution of Budget Values for Forecast Periods==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form, a user can add financial periods for project budget lines of the selected forecast revision in one of the following ways:[anchor|#_30f2fa21-7594-4792-9c85-d4c9d04548ac]
*Click the project budget line in the table, and on the table toolbar, click '''Add Periods''' to add a manually selected range of financial periods for the selected project budget line.
*In the form toolbar, click '''Generate Periods''' to automatically add financial periods for all the project budget lines selected in the table based on the selection criteria specified in the Summary area. For each line, the system adds the range of periods selected as follows:
**The starting financial period of the range is the earliest of the following periods:
***The financial period to which the '''Planned Start Date''' of the project task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form belongs
***The financial period to which the first actual or change order amount of the budget line was posted
***The financial period to which the '''Start Date''' of the project task on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form belongs, if no planned start date is found for the project task and no actual or change order amount has been posted for the project budget line
***The financial period to which the '''Start Date''' of the project on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form belongs, if no start date is found for the project task
**The ending financial period of the range is the latest of the following periods:
***The financial period to which the '''Planned End Date''' of the project task on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form belongs
***The financial period to which the last actual or change order amount of the budget line was posted

The system adds periods for the project budget lines with quantities and amounts of zero, as shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_5ec2ffa4-944c-4123-ae65-2324f1cf2039][anchor|#_574c644b-cb62-4c0e-8bc7-8cee3c2e363a][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Project_Budget_Forecast2.png|popup|Periods added for project budget forecast lines|400px]
A user can specify the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', '''Original Budgeted Amount''', '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''', and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' values for each period line of the project budget line manually.{br}

A user can also distribute the quantities and amounts of project budget lines among period lines automatically. On the form toolbar, the user clicks '''Distribute'''. In the '''Distribute''' dialog box (shown in the screenshot below), which is opened, the user can specify the following settings:[anchor|#_7bc5bb69-9e69-4762-b0ab-cf3d5a4108b7]
*In the '''Value''' section, the user selects one of the following options to define which values the system should distribute:
**'''Distribute Total''': The system distributes the values of the project budget line between all the period lines equally. All the values that have been already specified for the period lines will be overridden.
**'''Add Delta''': The system adds the delta, which is the difference between the values of the project budget line and the total values of the period lines, to all the period lines in proportion to the values that have been already specified for period lines.
*In the '''Columns''' section, the user selects the columns in which the system should distribute values.
*In the '''Rows''' section, the user specifies whether the system should distribute values for all the project budget lines in the table or for the selected project budget line only.

==Integration Between Forecasts and Projects==
From the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, a user can navigate to the last modified revision of the project budget forecast on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form by clicking '''Inquiries''' > '''Project Budget Forecast''' on the form toolbar. If the project has no budget forecast, a new forecast revision is created for the project.{br}

The user can click any project budget line and then click '''Update Forecast Line Lines''' on the table toolbar to update the selected project budget line of the forecast revision. For this selected line, the system adds the financial periods to which actual values or change orders values have been posted for the project budget line and that have been missed in the forecast revision.{br}

On the table toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, a user can also click '''Update Project Budget''' to update the values of the project budget lines on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form with the corresponding values of the project budget lines of the selected forecast revision. The original values of the project budget can be updated if the project budget is not locked. The revised values of the project budget can be updated if the change order workflow is disabled for the project.
==Upgrade Notes==
After the upgrade of Acumatica ERP from the 6.1 version to the 2019 R1           version  version, generic inquiries and reports that compare budget and actual values by financial period should be modified to use the data from the {{PMForecastDetail}} table instead of the {{PMProjectStatus}} table, because the upgrade procedure moves financial period-specific data from the {{PMProjectStatus}} table to {{PMForecastDetail}} table{br}

After the upgrade of Acumatica ERP from any version to the 2019 R1           version , on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_40_00|Validate Project Balances] ([~/?ScreenId=PM504000|PM504000]) form, a user needs to run the validation process with the '''Recalculate Change Orders''' check box selected.]]></column>

For each line, the system adds the range           of periods selected as follows: The starting financial period of the range is the earliest of the following                 periods: The financial period to which the  Planned Start Date  of                   the project task on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000)                   form belongs The financial period to which the first actual or change order amount of the                   budget line was posted The financial period to which the  Start Date  of the                   project task on the  Tasks  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form belongs, if no planned                   start date is found for the project task and no actual or change order amount has                   been posted for the project budget line The financial period to which the  Start Date  of the                   project on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form belongs, if no start date is found                   for the project task The ending financial period of the range is the latest of the following periods: The financial period to which the  Planned End Date  of the                   project task on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks form belongs The financial period to which the last actual or change order amount of the                   budget line was posted The system adds periods for the project budget lines with quantities and amounts of zero,         as shown in the following screenshot. Periods added for project budget forecast lines A user can specify the  Original Budgeted Quantity ,            Original Budgeted Amount ,  Revised Budgeted           Quantity , and  Revised Budgeted Amount  values for each         period line of the project budget line manually. A user can also distribute the quantities and amounts of project budget lines among period         lines automatically. On the form toolbar, the user clicks  Distribute .         In the  Distribute  dialog box (shown in the screenshot below), which         is opened, the user can specify the following settings: In the  Value  section, the user selects one of the following           options to define which values the system should distribute: Distribute Total : The system distributes the values of the               project budget line between all the period lines equally. All the values that have               been already specified for the period lines will be overridden. Add Delta : The system adds the delta, which is the difference               between the values of the project budget line and the total values of the period               lines, to all the period lines in proportion to the values that have been already               specified for period lines. In the  Columns  section, the user selects the columns in which the           system should distribute values. In the  Rows  section, the user specifies whether the system should           distribute values for all the project budget lines in the table or for the selected           project budget line only. The Distribute dialog box For each project budget line, in the  Original Budgeted Quantity ,            Original Budgeted Amount ,  Revised Budgeted           Quantity , and  Revised Budgeted Amount  columns, the         system calculates the following values, as shown in the screenshot below: Total : The total of the period lines Delta : The difference between the value of the project budget           line and the total of the period lines Distributed values of the project budget forecast Integration Between Forecasts and Projects From the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, a user can navigate         to the last modified revision of the project budget forecast on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) Project Budget Forecast (PM209600) form by clicking  Inquiries Project Budget Forecast  on the form toolbar. If the project has no budget forecast, a new forecast         revision is created for the project. The user can click any project budget line and then click  Update Forecast Line           Lines  on the table toolbar to update the selected project budget line of the         forecast revision. For this selected line, the system adds the financial periods to which         actual values or change orders values have been posted for the project budget line and that         have been missed in the forecast revision. On the table toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) Project Budget Forecast form, a user can         also click  Update Project Budget  to update the values of the project         budget lines on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form with the corresponding         values of the project budget lines of the selected forecast revision. The original values of         the project budget can be updated if the project budget is not locked. The revised values of         the project budget can be updated if the change order workflow is disabled for the         project. Upgrade Notes After the upgrade of  Acumatica ERP from the 6.1 version to the  2019 R1           version   version, generic inquiries and reports that compare budget and actual values         by financial period should be modified to use the data from the            PMForecastDetail  table instead of the  PMProjectStatus          table, because the upgrade procedure moves financial period-specific data from the            PMProjectStatus  table to  PMForecastDetail  table After the upgrade of  Acumatica ERP from any version to the  2019 R1           version  , on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM504000|PM504000]) Validate Project Balances (PM504000) form, a user         needs to run the validation process with the  Recalculate Change           Orders  check box selected. ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1           version , companies within the same tenant can have different fiscal year-end dates. With this functionality, users can accelerate implementation, run consolidated operational reports at any time, facilitate the preparation of consolidated financial statements, and simplify maintenance for companies that share vendors, stock items, and employees. The company-specific periods are defined at the branch level.{br}

To provide the ability to maintain different financial calendars, the ''Multiple Calendars Support'' feature should be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. Then users will be able to configure companies with different fiscal year-end dates within one tenant. The feature can be enabled only when the ''Centralized Period Management'' feature is disabled.{br}

==Impact of the ''Multiple Calendars Support'' Feature on Project Accounting==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, the financial period is company-specific and defined based on the transaction branch and the transaction date.{br}

{{PMTran.TranPeriodID}} now stores the ID of the master financial period. Also {{PMTran.TranPeriodID}} depends on {{PMTran.BranchID}} and {{PMTran.FinPeriodID}} instead of {{PMTran.Date}}.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, for the invoices created for a project, the financial period is defined based on the originating branch of the invoice.{br}

On the , all the amounts are shown and entered in the project currency.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form, the system uses the master calendar to retrieve the list of financial periods.{br}

The {{PMHistory}} table has the new {{BranchID}} key field. The table now stores actual balances by financial period of the master calendar and by company-specific financial period, which is defined by the branch. Previously, balances were not segregated by branch in this table. The {{Tran*}} columns of the {{PMHistory}} table contain values for master calendar financial periods. The {{Fin*}} columns of the table contain values for company-specific financial periods based on the {{PMTran.BranchID}} and {{PMTran.FinPeriodID}} data.{br}

The start period and end period parameters of the data source of ARM reports of the ''PM'' type are considered as financial periods of the master calendar.{br}

The ARM engine uses the left join clause of {{PMHistory}} and {{PMBudget}} with the following parameters: project, project task, inventory item, cost code, and account group. The branch is not included in the list of clause parameters. Therefore, in the ''Project History Details (CS600010)'' report, data from the {{PMBudget}} table is repeated for each branch used in the {{PMHistory}} table.
==Upgrade Notes==
During the upgrade of Acumatica ERP to the 2019 R1           version  version, the values of {{TranPeriodID}} of the {{PMTran}} table are replaced with the values of {{FinPeriodID}}. Also, the new {{BranchID}} key field is added to the {{PMHistory}} table.{br}

After the upgrade, the data in the {{PMHistory}} table needs to be rebuilt. To do so, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_40_00|Validate Project Balances] ([~/?ScreenId=PM504000|PM504000]) form, the user needs to select projects for which the data has to be rebuilt and run the process with all the optional parameters cleared in the Summary area.]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a new ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature has been introduced. With this feature enabled, users can enter project transactions in different currencies and maintain projects in both the base currency and the project currency.{br}

To start using this functionality, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, an administrative user enables the ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature. The ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature can be enabled only if the ''Multi-Currency Accounting'' feature has been enabled.{br}{TOC}
==Business Processes Provided by the Feature==
The ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature makes it possible to track a project in the project currency, which can differ from the base currency. With the feature enabled, users can do the following:[anchor|#_53c525fe-9cfd-4942-ab5a-35077ea26f1e]
*Manage project budgets in the project currency
*Review actual revenues, actual costs, and committed costs in the project currency, with an ability to calculate project profitability in both the project currency and the base currency, and present costs to the customer in the customer&rsquo;s currency
*Track actual balances in the base currency at the historical exchange rate
*Track cost commitments in the project currency at the historical exchange rate
*Track change orders for budgeted amounts in the project currency
*Create change orders for commitments in a currency that differs from the base currency and the project currency
*Bill projects by using progress billing based on the revenue budget that is defined in the project currency
*Apply the exchange rates of the project currency to time and material transactions billed by quantity
*Add markup to billable amounts in the project currency during time and material billing
*Re-bill the exact amount of an expense in a foreign currency if the currency of the expense transaction is the same as the project currency in which the project is billed, which can be useful to re-bill travel expenses incurred during visits to the customer
*Plan budgets by financial period and create budget forecasts in the project currency to compare actual budgets and change order amounts with monthly budgets
*Create a project quote in a foreign currency and convert the quote to a project in this currency

==Configuration of Exchange Rates==
Projects in a foreign currency use currency exchange rates that are configured and maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_30_10_00|Currency Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=CM301000|CM301000]) form.{br}

For multi-currency accounting in projects, as the default rate type, the system uses the rate type specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.[anchor|#section_fdf_x42_p2b]
==Projects with Multi-Currency Accounting==
Projects can have configurable currencies on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the project currency differs from the base currency, users can track the project in both the base currency and the project currency. (See the following screenshot.)[anchor|#fig_qlg_pbr_r2b][anchor|#image_rlg_pbr_r2b][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Project_Multi_Currency1.png|popup|Currencies, the rate type, and the rate of a project|400px]
For a new project created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system fills in the '''Project Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) with the customer&rsquo;s currency, which is selected in the '''Currency ID''' box on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. If the customer has no currency defined, the base currency is selected as the '''Project Currency'''. A user can change the '''Project Currency''' if the project has no transactions.{br}

The system selects the project currency in the '''Billing Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. This currency is used as the currency of the invoices created during the project billing. A user can select any currency as the '''Billing Currency''' if the project currency is the base currency.{br}

The following table lists possible configurations for common business scenarios.[anchor|#_f9daa89e-499f-4a66-8fb3-eae1fc03f603]

The '''Currency Rate for Budget''' (in the Summary area) is the exchange rate that is used to display amounts in the project and base currencies on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. By default, this is the exchange rate of the rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section). If this box is cleared, which is the default value, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.{br}

A user can click the exchange rate value in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Then in the '''Rate Selection''' dialog box, which is opened (shown in the following screenshot), the user can override the exchange rate for the project.[anchor|#_5949ab88-52d6-42ea-bf2e-30b7d5688b13][anchor|#_d417d1e4-0883-4055-b89f-77dbcd131943][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Project_Multi_Currency2.png|popup|The exchange rate for the project|200px]
By default, on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system shows the amounts in the project currency. A user can enter the amounts in the project currency only. If a user clicks the '''View Base''' button in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area, the system shows the budgeted amounts and balances in the base currency converted based on the rate shown in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box. To show the amounts in the project currency, the user clicks the '''View Cury''' button in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area.{br}

Only amounts in the '''Hist. Actual Amount in Base Currency''' column on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form are always shown in the base currency.
==Project Transactions with Multi-Currency Accounting==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, a user can create project transactions with the amount in any foreign currency. The system converts the amount of these transactions in the project currency, which is specified in the '''Project Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, as shown in the screenshot below.{br}

The '''Project Currency Rate''' of the project transaction is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.[anchor|#_c40b1d12-6b51-4bcd-a311-a5994593877a][anchor|#_e1fdda16-6a90-49f3-aabf-b86e25ffd217][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Project_Multi_Currency3.png|popup|Currencies of project transactions|400px]
You enter the amount of the project transaction in the transaction currency. The system uses this amount in the transaction currency to calculate the transaction amounts in the project currency and in the base currency. The system also updates the actual amounts of the project budget in the project currency and in the base currency with the corresponding amounts of the project transaction, as shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_36758d58-97a9-467b-a047-13f9a9d927c1][anchor|#_52723875-36b2-46d4-ad67-d0a16d2a99b8][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Project_Multi_Currency4.png|popup|The update of the project budget with transaction amounts|400px]
When the system creates a project transaction based on a general ledger transaction, the amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the general ledger transaction to the project transaction. The corresponding amount in the project currency of the project transaction is calculated based on the amount in the transaction currency. (See the following diagram.)[anchor|#_c1f6f2ab-3621-416d-95a6-6e5317906cfb][anchor|#_b0dd70f5-bb83-4e89-9afe-ebe67ae04c59][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Project_Multi_Currency5.png|popup|A project transaction created based on a GL transaction|300px]
When the system creates a general ledger transaction based on a project transaction, the amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the project transaction to the general ledger transaction, as the following diagram illustrates.[anchor|#_d0b16557-a678-4ce0-8593-833dfda5306d][anchor|#_7dd2a10e-f98e-4cea-a7dd-9044c25868aa][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Project_Multi_Currency6.png|popup|A GL transaction created based on a project transaction|300px]
==Invoices for Projects with Multi-Currency Accounting==
During project billing, the system creates pro forma or accounts receivable invoices in the billing currency of the project specified in the '''Billing Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

The exchange rate for the invoice is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ( '''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.{br}

A user can override the exchange rate for an invoice if for the customer, the '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form.{br}

All the invoice amounts can be reviewed in both the invoice currency and the base currency.
==Billing Process with Multi-Currency Accounting==
During the billing process, the system produces amounts in the project currency. Then the amounts are converted into the billing currency of the project, as shown in the following diagram.[anchor|#_f642a984-d259-43bc-86ca-9175753950ee][anchor|#_59675a2e-3cd8-4441-bc00-5b0c80ee0aa4][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_Project_Multi_Currency7.png|popup|The amounts calculated during the project billing|400px]
If the {{@Price}} parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, during the billing process with this billing rule, the system looks for the price in the project currency. If the price in the project currency is not found, the system converts the price from the base currency by using the exchange rate defined by the rate type of the project.{br}

If the {{@Rate}} parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] form, during the billing process with this billing rule, the system retrieves the rate as is for use in the user-defined formulas of the billing rule. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] form, in formulas of time and material steps of a billing rule, a user can convert an amount retrieved with the {{@Rate}} parameter by using the {{ConvertAmountToCurrency()}} function.{br}

The {{Report.ConvertAmountToCurrency(fromCuryID, toCuryID, rateType, effectiveDate, value)}} function has the following parameters:[anchor|#_8996a5fd-2fe8-4844-a643-507ac7ae8f12]
*{{fromCuryID}}: The source currency in which the {{@Rate}} has been defined
*{{toCuryID}}: The project currency
*{{rateType}}: The rate type of the project
*{{effectiveDate}}: The date on which the exchange rate is effective
*{{value}}: The amount to be converted

To re-bill an amount in the project currency as is, in the formula of a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, a user can use the following data field: {{[PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount]}}.
==Commitments with Multi-Currency Accounting==
The system creates commitments for a project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form in the project currency.{br}

The exchange rate from the document currency to the project currency for the creation of the commitment is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ( '''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.
==Project Quotes with Multi-Currency Accounting==
For a new project quote created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, the system fills in the '''Currency''' box in the Summary area with the business account&rsquo;s currency selected in the '''Currency ID''' box on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. If no currency is defined for the customer, the base currency is selected as the project quote currency.{br}

If a project quote is created based on an opportunity selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, the system selects the opportunity currency as the project quote currency.{br}

A user can change the project quote currency if for the customer, the '''Enable Currency Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form. If the user changes the project quote currency and the project quote is the primary quote of an opportunity, the system changes the opportunity currency accordingly.{br}

For project quotes, the system uses the exchange rate of the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form. A user can override the exchange rate for a project quote if for the customer, the '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

For the estimation lines of a project quote, the system converts the retrieved unit prices and unit costs of the selected inventory items to the project quote currency by using the exchange rate of the project quote.{br}

Although all the project quote amounts can be reviewed in both the project quote currency and the base currency, a user can edit the amounts only in the project quote currency.{br}

When a project is created based on the project quote, the system copies to the project the project quote currency, the exchange rate of the project quote, and the price and cost information from the project quote in the project currency.
==Project Budget Forecasts with Multi-Currency Accounting==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form, all the amounts are shown and entered in the project currency.
==ARM Reports==
ARM reports of the ''PM'' type retrieve amounts in the project currency.
==Upgrade Notes==
During the upgrade to Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, for every project, the project currency is set to the base currency. The existing budgets, actual balances, and committed balances become values in the base currency and the project currency after the upgrade. The project currency cannot be changed for a project that already has actual balances or commitments.
==Breaking Changes==
The ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature causes the following breaking changes:[anchor|#_d21d7da3-c818-4209-b041-c70a342cc1ff]
*As a result of the upgrade, the project currency of all the projects is set to the base currency.
*The billing currency depends on the project currency instead of the customer currency.
*The amount data fields of the {{PMTran}} data access class become the following:
**{{PMTran.TranCuryAmount}}: The amount in the transaction currency
**{{PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount}}: The amount in the project currency
**{{PMTran.Amount}}: The amount in the base currency of the project
*:The amount data fields of the {{PMBudget}} data access class become the following:
**{{PMBudget.CuryActualAmount}}: The amount in the project currency, which is the sum of the corresponding {{PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount}} values
**{{PMBudget.ActualAmount}}: The amount in the base currency, which is the sum of the corresponding {{PMTran.Amount}} values
*The {{PMHistory}} table has the new {{BranchID}} key field. The table now stores actual balances by financial period of the master calendar and by company-specific financial period, which is defined by the branch. Previously, balances were not segregated by branch in this table.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, if the value of the '''Quantity''', '''Billable Quantity''', or '''Unit Rate''' column is changed, the system recalculates the '''Amount''', which previously was not recalculated in this case.
*Project commitments are captured in the project currency instead of the base currency.
*:The {{PMChangeOrderLine.AmountInBaseCury}} data field has been renamed to {{PMChangeOrderLine.AmountInProjectCury}}. On the '''Commitments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, the corresponding column has been renamed to the '''Amount in Project Currency''' (from '''Amount in Base Currency''').
*The contract-based API version 18.2 has been remapped to the {{Cury}} data fields.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Projects: Multi-Currency Accounting In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a new  Multi-Currency Projects  feature has been introduced. With this feature         enabled, users can enter project transactions in different currencies and maintain projects         in both the base currency and the project currency. To start using this functionality, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000)         form, an administrative user enables the  Multi-Currency Projects  feature. The            Multi-Currency Projects  feature can be enabled only if the  Multi-Currency           Accounting  feature has been enabled. Business Processes Provided by the Feature The  Multi-Currency Projects  feature makes it possible to track a project in the         project currency, which can differ from the base currency. With the feature enabled, users         can do the following: Manage project budgets in the project currency Review actual revenues, actual costs, and committed costs in the project currency, with           an ability to calculate project profitability in both the project currency and the base           currency, and present costs to the customer in the customer's currency Track actual balances in the base currency at the historical exchange rate Track cost commitments in the project currency at the historical exchange rate Track change orders for budgeted amounts in the project currency Create change orders for commitments in a currency that differs from the base currency           and the project currency Bill projects by using progress billing based on the revenue budget that is defined in           the project currency Apply the exchange rates of the project currency to time and material transactions           billed by quantity Add markup to billable amounts in the project currency during time and material           billing Re-bill the exact amount of an expense in a foreign currency if the currency of the           expense transaction is the same as the project currency in which the project is billed,           which can be useful to re-bill travel expenses incurred during visits to the customer Plan budgets by financial period and create budget forecasts in the project currency to           compare actual budgets and change order amounts with monthly budgets Create a project quote in a foreign currency and convert the quote to a project in this           currency Configuration of Exchange Rates Projects in a foreign currency use currency exchange rates that are configured and         maintained on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM301000|CM301000]) Currency Rates (CM301000) form. For multi-currency accounting in projects, as the default rate type, the system uses the         rate type specified in the  PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate           Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000)         form. Projects with Multi-Currency Accounting Projects can have configurable currencies on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. If the project currency differs from the base currency, users can track         the project in both the base currency and the project currency. (See the following         screenshot.) Currencies, the rate type, and the rate of a project For a new project created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the         system fills in the  Project Currency  box on the            Summary  tab ( Project Properties  section)         with the customer's currency, which is selected in the  Currency ID          box on the  General Info  tab ( Financial           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers         (AR303000) form. If the customer has no currency defined, the base currency is selected as         the  Project Currency . A user can change the  Project           Currency  if the project has no transactions. The system selects the project currency in the  Billing Currency  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form.         This currency is used as the currency of the invoices created during the project billing. A         user can select any currency as the  Billing Currency  if the project         currency is the base currency. The following table lists possible configurations for common business scenarios. Business Scenario Possible Configuration Base Currency Project Currency Billing Currency A company performs projects for local clients only. The project currency equals the base currency. All currencies are the same. The                 configuration is backward-compatible. USD USD USD A company performs projects for local clients but can occasionally have a                 project for a foreign client. The project currency equals the base currency. The billing currency differs                 from the project currency and the base currency. The configuration is                 backward-compatible. USD USD CAD A company performs projects for local and foreign clients. The project currency differs from the base currency. The billing currency                 always equals the project currency. The configuration is new. USD CAD CAD only The  Currency Rate for Budget  (in the Summary area) is the exchange         rate that is used to display amounts in the project and base currencies on the            Revenue Budget ,  Cost Budget , and            Balances  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form. By default, this is the exchange rate of the rate type selected in the            Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section). If this box is cleared, which is the         default value, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the            PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate Types          section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. A user can click the exchange rate value in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Then in the  Rate           Selection  dialog box, which is opened (shown in the following screenshot), the         user can override the exchange rate for the project. The exchange rate for the project By default, on the  Revenue Budget ,  Cost           Budget , and  Balances  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system shows the amounts in the project         currency. A user can enter the amounts in the project currency only. If a user clicks the            View Base  button in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area, the system shows the budgeted amounts and         balances in the base currency converted based on the rate shown in the  Currency           Rate for Budget  box. To show the amounts in the project currency, the user         clicks the  View Cury  button in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area. Only amounts in the  Hist. Actual Amount in Base Currency  column on         the  Revenue Budget ,  Cost Budget , and            Balances  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form are always shown in the base currency. Project Transactions with Multi-Currency Accounting On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, a user can create         project transactions with the amount in any foreign currency. The system converts the amount         of these transactions in the project currency, which is specified in the  Project           Currency  box on the  Summary  tab ( Project           Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form, as shown in the screenshot below. The  Project Currency Rate  of the project transaction is defined by         the project-specific rate type selected in the  Currency Rate Type  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Project Properties          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. If the project has no         rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the            PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate Types          section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. Currencies of project transactions You enter the amount of the project transaction in the transaction currency. The system         uses this amount in the transaction currency to calculate the transaction amounts in the         project currency and in the base currency. The system also updates the actual amounts of the         project budget in the project currency and in the base currency with the corresponding         amounts of the project transaction, as shown in the following diagram. The update of the project budget with transaction amounts When the system creates a project transaction based on a general ledger transaction, the         amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the         general ledger transaction to the project transaction. The corresponding amount in the         project currency of the project transaction is calculated based on the amount in the         transaction currency. (See the following diagram.) A project transaction created based on a GL transaction When the system creates a general ledger transaction based on a project transaction, the         amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the         project transaction to the general ledger transaction, as the following diagram         illustrates. A GL transaction created based on a project transaction Invoices for Projects with Multi-Currency Accounting During project billing, the system creates pro forma or accounts receivable invoices in the         billing currency of the project specified in the  Billing Currency  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. The exchange rate for the invoice is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in         the  Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. If the project has no rate type selected, the         system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the  PM Rate           Type  box (  Default Rate Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. A user can override the exchange rate for an invoice if for the customer, the            Enable Rate Override  check box is selected on the            General Info  tab ( Financial Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers (AR303000) form. All the invoice amounts can be reviewed in both the invoice currency and the base         currency. Billing Process with Multi-Currency Accounting During the billing process, the system produces amounts in the project currency. Then the         amounts are converted into the billing currency of the project, as shown in the following         diagram. The amounts calculated during the project billing If the  @Price  parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing         rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, during the billing         process with this billing rule, the system looks for the price in the project currency. If         the price in the project currency is not found, the system converts the price from the base         currency by using the exchange rate defined by the rate type of the project. If the  @Rate  parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing         rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules form, during the billing process         with this billing rule, the system retrieves the rate as is for use in the user-defined         formulas of the billing rule. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules form, in         formulas of time and material steps of a billing rule, a user can convert an amount         retrieved with the  @Rate  parameter by using the            ConvertAmountToCurrency()  function. The  Report.ConvertAmountToCurrency(fromCuryID, toCuryID, rateType, effectiveDate,           value)  function has the following parameters: fromCuryID : The source currency in which the  @Rate  has           been defined toCuryID : The project currency rateType : The rate type of the project effectiveDate : The date on which the exchange rate is effective value : The amount to be converted To re-bill an amount in the project currency as is, in the formula of a time and material         step of a billing rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form,         a user can use the following data field:  [PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount] . Commitments with Multi-Currency Accounting The system creates commitments for a project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form in the project currency. The exchange rate from the document currency to the project currency for the creation of         the commitment is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the            Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. If the project has no rate type         selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the  PM           Rate Type  box (  Default Rate Types  section) on the             ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. Project Quotes with Multi-Currency Accounting For a new project quote created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes         (PM304500) form, the system fills in the  Currency  box in the Summary         area with the business account's currency selected in the  Currency ID          box on the  General Info  tab ( Financial           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers         (AR303000) form. If no currency is defined for the customer, the base currency is selected         as the project quote currency. If a project quote is created based on an opportunity selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000) form, the system selects the opportunity         currency as the project quote currency. A user can change the project quote currency if for the customer, the  Enable           Currency Override  check box is selected on the  General           Info  tab ( Financial Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. If the user changes the project quote         currency and the project quote is the primary quote of an opportunity, the system changes         the opportunity currency accordingly. For project quotes, the system uses the exchange rate of the default rate type of projects         specified in the  PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate           Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000)         form. A user can override the exchange rate for a project quote if for the customer, the            Enable Rate Override  check box is selected on the            General Info  tab ( Financial Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. For the estimation lines of a project quote, the system converts the retrieved unit prices         and unit costs of the selected inventory items to the project quote currency by using the         exchange rate of the project quote. Although all the project quote amounts can be reviewed in both the project quote currency         and the base currency, a user can edit the amounts only in the project quote currency. When a project is created based on the project quote, the system copies to the project the         project quote currency, the exchange rate of the project quote, and the price and cost         information from the project quote in the project currency. Project Budget Forecasts with Multi-Currency Accounting On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) Project Budget Forecast (PM209600) form, all the amounts are         shown and entered in the project currency. ARM Reports ARM reports of the  PM  type retrieve amounts in the project currency. Upgrade Notes During the upgrade to  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, for every project, the project currency is set to the base currency. The existing         budgets, actual balances, and committed balances become values in the base currency and the         project currency after the upgrade. The project currency cannot be changed for a project         that already has actual balances or commitments. Breaking Changes The  Multi-Currency Projects  feature causes the following breaking changes: As a result of the upgrade, the project currency of all the projects is set to the base           currency. The billing currency depends on the project currency instead of the customer           currency. The amount data fields of the  PMTran  data access class become the             following: PMTran.TranCuryAmount : The amount in the transaction currency PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount : The amount in the project currency PMTran.Amount : The amount in the base currency of the project The amount data fields of the  PMBudget  data access class become             the following: PMBudget.CuryActualAmount : The amount in the project currency,               which is the sum of the corresponding  PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount                values PMBudget.ActualAmount : The amount in the base currency, which is               the sum of the corresponding  PMTran.Amount  values The  PMHistory  table has the new  BranchID  key field.             The table now stores actual balances by financial period of the master calendar and by             company-specific financial period, which is defined by the branch. Previously, balances             were not segregated by branch in this table. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, if the value of the              Quantity ,  Billable Quantity , or              Unit Rate  column is changed, the system recalculates the              Amount , which previously was not recalculated in this case. Project commitments are captured in the project currency instead of the base             currency. The  PMChangeOrderLine.AmountInBaseCury  data field has been             renamed to  PMChangeOrderLine.AmountInProjectCury . On the                Commitments  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form, the corresponding column has             been renamed to the  Amount in Project Currency  (from                Amount in Base Currency ). The contract-based API version 18.2 has been remapped to the  Cury  data           fields. ]]></column>

==The New Appointment History Map==
The [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_12_00|Appointment History Map] ([~/?ScreenId=FS301200|FS301200]) form has been created (see the screenshot below). The new map has a similar interface to that of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_11_00|Staff Appointments on Map] ([~/?ScreenId=FS301100|FS301100]) form. The difference between these maps is that the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_12_00|Appointment History Map] form shows both the route suggested by Bing maps and the actual route of the staff member, which is calculated based on the location tracking engine of the mobile app.{br}

In the map area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_12_00|Appointment History Map] form, you can view the following information (also shown in the screenshot below) for the date and branch (if applicable) selected in the '''Staff''' pane:[anchor|#_a5d8f85a-51ba-458b-b7da-334f14fcc3b5]
*The actual route of the staff member: The route is displayed in green color. The system generates it in accordance with the locations tracked for the user.
*The route of the staff member that was suggested by Bing Maps: The route is displayed in the default color of Bing Maps. This is the route that has been built by Bing Maps.
*The latest location of the staff member: The most recent location is marked with a driver location (''D'') icon. You click this icon to see the location information (that is, the staff member&rsquo;s name and the time when the location was registered).
*The locations where the staff member was idle: These are the locations at which the staff member stayed for more than 15 minutes within a 5-kilometer or 3.1-mile range. These locations are displayed as yellow dots. You can click any yellow dot to see the time range when the staff member was at this location.
*The locations where a staff member was moving: At these locations, the staff member stayed for less than 15 minutes within a 5-kilometer or 3.1-mile range—that is, the staff member was moving. These locations are displayed as green dots. You can click any green dot to see the time when the staff member was at this location.

In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, this has been changed to follow the same standard that is followed for other entry         documents. The contact and address information of service orders, appointments, branch         locations, and manufacturers are stored in the new  FSAddress  and            FSContact  database tables.  The following columns have been removed from the  FSServiceOrder  (service         orders and appointments; the data of these entities is stored in the same table),            FSBranchLocation  (branch locations), and            FSManufacturer  (manufacturers) database tables: AddressLine1 AddressLine2 AddressLine3 State City CountryID PostalCode Salutation Phone1 Phone2 Phone3 Fax EMail WebSite IsValidated The following columns have been added to the  FSAddress  and  FSContact      tables: ServiceOrderAddressID  and  ServiceOrderContactID  (for service order and      appointment address and contact information)  BranchLocationAddressID  and  BranchLocationContactID  (for branch location      address and contact information)  ManufacturerAddressID  and  ManufacturerContactID   (for manufacturer address      and contact information)  If developers have created customizations or reports that contain address         or contact tables of service orders and appointments, branch locations, or manufacturers,         the customizations and reports must be updated with new tables before the upgrade.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
Various features have been added to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_07_00|Room Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300700|FS300700]) forms, as described in the sections below. For details, see the [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/(W(3))/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=18d2ed6e-39a5-40cc-9555-46ec88025365|Calendar Boards and Maps] chapter of the Interface guide.{br}{TOC}
==Ability to Change the Dashboard Orientation==
In previous versions of Acumatica ERP, the dashboards of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_07_00|Room Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300700|FS300700]) forms were oriented vertically—that is, staff members were located on the horizontal axis and time was located on the vertical axis of the dashboard (see the screenshot below). {br}

In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a user can change the orientation of the dashboard by clicking the button that is located in the lower right corner of the dashboard (see the following screenshot). [anchor|#_744ab00c-b51b-4d9f-800d-299d91dd13bd][anchor|#_c38f8095-17fc-4573-b61e-bde674670f71][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Horizontal.png|popup|The horizontal orientation of the dashboard|450px]
If the user clicks this button while viewing the vertical orientation, the orientation is changed to horizontal so that the staff members are shown on the vertical axis and time is shown on the horizontal axis, as shown in the following screenshot. [anchor|#_f6033f59-a240-4bdb-ace9-78aac7d970a1][anchor|#_74d0974e-f5b8-40e8-85cd-e2917adddbd4][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Vertical.png|popup|The vertical orientation of the dashboard|450px]
If the user clicks this button again (while viewing the horizontal orientation, the orientation is changed back to vertical).{br}

To give an administrator the ability to set the default orientation for the instance, on the '''Calendars and Maps''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form, the '''View Mode''' box has been added with the following options: ''Vertical'' and ''Horizontal''.[anchor|#_f74b1266-2405-46fc-b976-698adcc17525][anchor|#_228a6e53-38ec-4ad3-ba2f-af9922094979][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_View_Mode.png|popup|The View Mode box and its options|400px]
==Ability to Change the Time Range==
In previous versions of Acumatica ERP, schedules for only one day have been shown on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_07_00|Room Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300700|FS300700]) forms. In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a user can now change the time range to show schedules for one week or one month. To do so, the user selects the necessary option in the new box in the upper right corner of the dashboard (see the screenshots below). This functionality gives the user the ability to perform such actions as reassigning an appointment from one staff member to another on a different date, viewing the agenda for a group of staff members on a particular week or month, or viewing the availability of rooms on a particular week or month.{br}

The following options are available in this new box: [anchor|#_60b701b3-d3d7-4887-8504-788fd5b3e2f2]
*''Day'': One day is shown on the dashboard (see the screenshot below).
*:The Date box shows the selected date (for example, Jan 11, 2019). By clicking the arrow buttons right and left of the Date box, the user can change the date displayed on the dashboard.[anchor|#_35450353-2bc4-4ae0-9743-3f3c3e809020][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Date_Time_Range.png|popup|The Day view of the Calendar Board|450px]
*''Week'': One week (Sunday to Saturday) is shown on the dashboard (see the screenshot below).
*:The Date box shows the date interval (for example, Jan 6, 2018–Jan 12, 2019). By clicking the arrow buttons right and left of the Date box, the user can change the week displayed on the dashboard. If the user selects a date by using the Calendar dialog box, the Date box shows the week that contains the selected date. [anchor|#_99c87d3b-4168-4bf7-9720-5494dba5c24f][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Week_Time_Range.png|popup|The Week view of the Calendar Board|450px]
*''Month'': One month (from the first day of the month to the last day of the month is shown on the dashboard (see the screenshot below).
*:The Date box shows the selected month (for example, January 2019). By clicking the arrow buttons right and left of the Date box, the user can change the month displayed on the dashboard. If a user selects a date by using the Calendar dialog box, the box shows the month that contains the selected date. [anchor|#_94994b43-c6f6-4b5c-b0c8-f83ae043a089][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Month_Time_Range.png|popup|The Month view of the Calendar Board|450px]

The time range functionality is available in both the ''Horizontal'' and ''Vertical'' view modes.{br}

To give an administrator the ability to set the default time range for the instance, on the '''Calendars and Maps''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_01_00|Service Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) form, the '''Time Range''' box has been added with the following options: ''Day'', ''Week'', and ''Month''. (See the following screenshot.)[anchor|#_d67329af-1ca8-4513-b194-050238c551ac][anchor|#_f67554e5-9345-4fdd-8666-daef43564e47][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Time_Range.png|popup|The Time Range box and its options|400px]
==Ability to Change the Time Resolution==
In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a user can now change the time resolution in the ''Vertical'' view mode on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_03_00|Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_07_00|Room Calendar Board] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300700|FS300700]) forms. To make this possible, a new time zoom slide and buttons have been added to the lower right section of the dashboard, as the following screenshot shows.[anchor|#_aeae59d4-d71e-4cb2-b060-d8c26be7e59b][anchor|#_bbd4a818-d80e-44fa-9908-f5777f530e26][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Time_Resolution.png|popup|The zoom slide and buttons|450px]
A user can change the time resolution in one of the following ways:[anchor|#_70155c39-e9b8-4249-bf8b-a875f7baee2d]
*By moving the slide. When the user moves the slide, a tooltip appears showing the current resolution.
*By clicking the minus or plus button.

The following screenshots show the view of the calendar for different time ranges with different time resolution.[anchor|#_052d61a9-e3d7-4e97-bc07-6f344894548f][anchor|#_497c9bec-032c-4575-8b69-aaad3ebfd47c][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Day_14.png|popup|The Calendar Board view for the Day time range with different resolutions|400px][anchor|#_1cd557bc-c68a-4b2b-b995-0dfccacb7351][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Day_16.png|popup|The Calendar Board view for the Day time range with different resolutions|400px][anchor|#_4fe6e893-ea62-4306-932e-398fcb313129][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Day_17.png|popup|The Calendar Board view for the Day time range with different resolutions|400px][anchor|#_b0fe4ad6-3f4e-4562-b2a1-babe5f3dba25][anchor|#_64275410-0b00-4a4f-a95c-79453250b7c9][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Week_10.png|popup|The Calendar Board view for the Week time range with different resolutions|400px][anchor|#_f2d8d9b1-4cd8-4c4e-8fc0-5b65ed5d37e5][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Week_16.png|popup|The Calendar Board view for the Week time range with different resolutions|400px][anchor|#_634d7c4f-453b-463a-b347-4c24efd0a3a7][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Week_18.png|popup|The Calendar Board view for the Week time range with different resolutions|400px][anchor|#_6d9d0648-4887-4024-8357-5ac2282d49ac][anchor|#_eb635b69-e88f-4081-a26f-e4530b28f540][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Month_6.png|popup|The Calendar Board view for the Month time range with different resolutions|400px][anchor|#_5ea42cce-8ed0-4440-ac07-100bbf647f07][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Month_16.png|popup|The Calendar Board view for the Month time range with different resolutions|400px][anchor|#_f78b5988-9850-4108-8f7f-1a9cb6c5f692][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019R1_Services_Calendar_Month_18.png|popup|The Calendar Board view for the Month time range with different resolutions|400px]

The vertical orientation of the dashboard If the user clicks this button again (while viewing the horizontal orientation, the         orientation is changed back to vertical). To give an administrator the ability to set the default orientation for the instance, on the            Calendars and Maps  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form, the  View           Mode  box has been added with the following options:  Vertical  and            Horizontal . The View Mode box and its options Ability to Change the Time Range In previous versions of  Acumatica ERP, schedules for only one day have been shown on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) and   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300700|FS300700]) Room Calendar Board (FS300700) forms. In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a user can now change the time range to show schedules for one week or one month. To do         so, the user selects the necessary option in the new box in the upper right corner of the         dashboard (see the screenshots below). This functionality gives the user the ability to         perform such actions as reassigning an appointment from one staff member to another on a         different date, viewing the agenda for a group of staff members on a particular week or         month, or viewing the availability of rooms on a particular week or month. The following options are available in this new box:  Day : One day is shown on the dashboard (see the screenshot below). The Date box             shows the selected date (for example, Jan 11, 2019). By clicking the arrow buttons right             and left of the Date box, the user can change the date displayed on the             dashboard. The Day view of the Calendar Board Week : One week (Sunday to Saturday) is shown on the dashboard (see the screenshot             below). The Date box shows the date interval (for example, Jan 6, 2018–Jan 12,             2019). By clicking the arrow buttons right and left of the Date box, the user can change             the week displayed on the dashboard. If the user selects a date by using the Calendar             dialog box, the Date box shows the week that contains the selected date.  The Week view of the Calendar Board Month : One month (from the first day of the month to the last day of the month is           shown on the dashboard (see the screenshot below). The Date box shows the selected month             (for example, January 2019). By clicking the arrow buttons right and left of the Date             box, the user can change the month displayed on the dashboard. If a user selects a date             by using the Calendar dialog box, the box shows the month that contains the selected             date.  The Month view of the Calendar Board The time range functionality is available in both the  Horizontal  and  Vertical      view modes. To give an administrator the ability to set the default time range for the instance, on the            Calendars and Maps  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form, the  Time           Range  box has been added with the following options:  Day ,  Week ,         and  Month . (See the following screenshot.) The Time Range box and its options Ability to Change the Time Resolution In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a user can now change the time resolution in the  Vertical  view mode on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) and   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300700|FS300700]) Room Calendar Board (FS300700) forms. To make this possible, a new time         zoom slide and buttons have been added to the lower right section of the dashboard, as the         following screenshot shows. The zoom slide and buttons A user can change the time resolution in one of the following ways: By moving the slide. When the user moves the slide, a tooltip appears showing the current           resolution. By clicking the minus or plus button. The following screenshots show the view of the calendar for different time ranges with         different time resolution. The Calendar Board view for the Day time range with different resolutions The Calendar Board view for the Week time range with different resolutions The Calendar Board view for the Month time range with different resolutions On the  Calendars and Maps  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form, the following boxes have been         added (as shown in the screenshot below):  Day Resolution : The default time resolution for the  Day  view           mode on calendar boards.  Week Resolution : The default time resolution for the  Week  view           mode on calendar boards.

The resolution settings Ability to Set Time Filters In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, a user can now display information filtered by time on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300300|FS300300]) Calendar Board (FS300300) and   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300700|FS300700]) Room Calendar Board (FS300700) forms. The Time Filter box has been         added to the lower right corner of the dashboard with the following options (see the         screenshots below): Cleared Filter : No filters are applied to the dashboard. That is, the dashboard shows      information for 24 hours of each day of the selected time range selected. The Cleared Filter option Working Time : The dashboard shows information for the start and end time of working           hours for each day of the selected time range (see the following screenshot).  The Working Time option The start time and end time of working hours are specified in the  Day               Start Time  and  Day End Time  boxes on the                Calendars and Maps  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100100|FS100100]) Service Management Preferences (FS100100) form, as the following screenshot             shows.

* '''Allow Assignment of Multiple Staff Members'''
* '''Allow Creation Without Specifying a Service'''
* '''Allow Creation Without Assigning a Staff Member'''
{br}

Depending on whether or not each check box was selected, the system performed extra validation steps. For example, if '''Allow Only One Appointment per Service Order''' had been selected, when a user attempted to create an appointment, the system performed validation to be sure no other appointments exist for the specified service order. Based on whether the check boxes are selected or cleared, as described below, the appropriate system users need to prepare the system before upgrading it.{br}

Additional changes have been made to the UI of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] form as well.{br}{TOC}
==System Upgrade Notes==
Before upgrading to Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, an appropriate system user has to verify whether the check boxes for each service order type defined in your system are set on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form as described below—that is, whether validations are turned on for any service order type. If any of the check boxes is set to perform validation for any service order type, the user has to contact the Acumatica ERP support team for help with the upgrade process.{br}

The following settings correspond to validations that are turned on for the service order type:[anchor|#_64c88f54-f5e6-4ee6-bd9f-4a9c87e6303a]
*'''Allow Only One Appointment per Service Order''': Selected 
*:If this check box is selected, the system allows only one appointment per service order.
*'''Allow Only One Service per Service Order/Appointment''': Selected
*:If this check box is selected, the system allows only one service per service order and appointment.
*'''Allow Assignment of Multiple Staff Members''': Cleared
*:If this check box is cleared, the system allows only one staff member to be assigned to an appointment.
*'''Allow Creation Without Specifying a Service''': Cleared
*:If this check box is cleared, the system allows the creation of appointments only if at least one service has been assigned to an appointment.
*'''Allow Creation Without Assigning a Staff Member''': Cleared
*:If this check box is cleared, the system allows the creation of appointments only if at least one staff member has been assigned to an appointment.

==Other UI Changes==
The UI of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_23_00|Service Order Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS202300|FS202300]) form has been modified to follow the standards established in other Acumatica ERP forms in which maintenance settings are specified. The following changes have been made (see the screenshot below):[anchor|#_fed1a082-1f4c-4378-8ba7-375da405e929]
*The '''Numbering Sequence''' and '''Behavior''' boxes have been moved to the '''General Settings''' section of the '''Preferences''' tab.
*The '''Appointment Settings''' section has been renamed to '''Default Settings'''.
*The '''Take Address and Contact Information From''' group of option buttons is now a box with a drop-down list.
*In the '''Take Address and Contact Information From''' box, the'' Customer Contact'' option has been renamed to ''Contact''.
*The '''Salesperson ID''' box and the '''Commissionable''' check box have been moved to the '''Default Settings''' section.
*The '''Post Pickup/Delivery Items to Inventory''' check box is now visible only if'' Route'' is selected in the '''General Settings''' section of the '''Preferences''' tab, which means that service orders of the type are fulfilled by appointments to provide a route service.

Previously, the numbering of service contracts on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) forms was performed automatically by the system, as was the numbering of schedules on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) forms.{br}

The contract numbering consisted solely of numerals, and the system generated the number for each particular customer independently; thus, the same contract numbers could be assigned to multiple contracts. For example, the ''ABARTENDE'' customer had service contracts with the ''00001'' and ''00002'' reference numbers, and the ''ABCHOLDING'' customer had a service contract with the ''00001'' reference number. The schedule numbers, which were a combination of the service contract number and the number of the schedule sequence, were also generated by the system. For example, ''00001-1'' was the number of the first schedule of the ''00001'' contract for ''ABARTENDE'' (and the number of the first schedule of the ''00001'' contract for ''ABCHOLDING''). Thus, to select a particular contract or contract schedule, a user had to first select the customer and then select the reference number of the document.{br}

In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the following numbering sequences for service contracts and schedules have been defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form:[anchor|#_ec015a07-d9eb-4af3-903e-200ab716e9bd]
*''FSCONTRACT (FS Contract)'': The numbering sequence for service and route service contracts, which has the'' FCT00000000'' format and a numbering step of ''1''
* ''FSSCHEDULE (FS Schedule)'': The numbering sequence for service and route service contract schedules, which has the'' FSC00000000'' format and a numbering step of ''1''

The system uses these numbering sequences to generate the identifiers for service contracts and their schedules for all customers. Thus, each identifier is unique in the system.((({S:Hint}The previous numbering sequence for service contracts and schedule is stored in the database, and the system still continues to generate the numbers of contracts and schedules by using the old sequence along with generation of the numbers of contracts and schedules by using the new sequence.
))){br}{TOC}
==System Upgrade Notes==
During the upgrade to Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the system automatically uses the ''FSCONTRACT'' numbering sequence to assign numbers to the existing service contracts and the ''FSSCHEDULE'' numbering sequence to assign numbers to the existing contract schedules.{br}

If it is necessary in a particular company to use the old numbers in reports or in a customization, an appropriate administrative user has to update the reports or the customization as follows to refer to the new database columns:[anchor|#_039618f6-dbfc-416a-8d34-0134a24c7ae3]
*For service contracts, the old numbering sequence is stored in the <tt>CustomerContractNbr</tt> column of the <tt>FSServiceContract</tt> database table. 
*For service contact schedules, the old numbering sequence is stored in the <tt>OldContractScheudleRefNbr</tt> column of the <tt>FSSchedule</tt> database table. 

==Changes on the Preference Forms==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_03_00|Equipment Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100300|FS100300]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_04_00|Route Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=FS100400|FS100400]) forms, the new following boxes have been added (see the screenshot below, which shows these boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_10_03_00|Equipment Management Preferences] form):[anchor|#_234f44e0-b6ba-45bc-ac4c-5ecc081b1398]

==Changes on the Service Contracts and Route Service Contracts Forms==
The following changes have been made on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_08_00|Route Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) forms (see the screenshot below, which shows these changes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] form):[anchor|#_cf278b99-8ab7-4b62-b7fe-8738d984e26b]
*The '''Service Contract ID''' box has been added to the form. For documents that already existed at the time of the upgrade, this is the new identifier of the document, which was inserted during the upgrade. For new documents that are generated after the upgrade, the system automatically generates this ID by using the numbering sequence assigned on the respective preference form. Because now the generation of the service contract identifiers does not depend on customers, a user doesn&rsquo;t need to select customer to view a particular contract created in the system.
*The '''Customer Contract Nbr.''' box has been added, which contains the number generated by using the old numbering sequence. This box is read-only, and the system continues to generate its reference numbers (using the old sequence) after the upgrade. 
*The '''Branch''' and '''Branch Location''' boxes have been moved to the '''Billing Settings''' section of the '''Summary''' tab.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Services: Numbering Sequences for Service Contracts and Their Schedules Previously, the numbering of service contracts on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) Service Contracts (FS305700) and   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) Route Service Contracts (FS300800) forms was performed automatically by the         system, as was the numbering of schedules on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) Service Contract Schedules (FS305100) and   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) Route Service Contract Schedules (FS305600) forms. The contract numbering consisted solely of numerals, and the system generated the number         for each particular customer independently; thus, the same contract numbers could be         assigned to multiple contracts. For example, the  ABARTENDE  customer had service         contracts with the  00001  and  00002  reference numbers, and the            ABCHOLDING  customer had a service contract with the  00001  reference number.         The schedule numbers, which were a combination of the service contract number and the number         of the schedule sequence, were also generated by the system. For example,  00001-1  was         the number of the first schedule of the  00001  contract for  ABARTENDE  (and the         number of the first schedule of the  00001  contract for  ABCHOLDING ). Thus, to         select a particular contract or contract schedule, a user had to first select the customer         and then select the reference number of the document. In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the following numbering sequences for service contracts and schedules have been defined         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form: FSCONTRACT (FS Contract) : The numbering sequence for service and route service           contracts, which has the  FCT00000000  format and a numbering step of  1 FSSCHEDULE (FS Schedule) : The numbering sequence for service and route service           contract schedules, which has the  FSC00000000  format and a numbering step of              1 The system uses these numbering sequences to generate the identifiers for service contracts         and their schedules for all customers. Thus, each identifier is unique in the system. The previous numbering sequence for service contracts and schedule is stored         in the database, and the system still continues to generate the numbers of contracts and         schedules by using the old sequence along with generation of the numbers of contracts and         schedules by using the new sequence. System Upgrade Notes During the upgrade to  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, the system automatically uses the  FSCONTRACT  numbering sequence to assign numbers         to the existing service contracts and the  FSSCHEDULE  numbering sequence to assign         numbers to the existing contract schedules. If it is necessary in a particular company to use the old numbers in reports or in a         customization, an appropriate administrative user has to update the reports or the         customization as follows to refer to the new database columns: For service contracts, the old numbering sequence is stored in the                CustomerContractNbr  column of the  FSServiceContract  database table.  For service contact schedules, the old numbering sequence is stored in the                OldContractScheudleRefNbr  column of the  FSSchedule  database table.            Changes on the Preference Forms On the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100300|FS100300]) Equipment Management Preferences (FS100300) and   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100400|FS100400]) Route Management Preferences (FS100400) forms, the new following boxes have been         added (see the screenshot below, which shows these boxes on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS100300|FS100300]) Equipment Management Preferences form): Service Contract Numbering Sequence : The numbering sequence the           system uses to assign identifiers to the service contracts created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) Service Contracts (FS305700) form and route service contracts           created on   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) Route Service Contracts (FS300800) form. By default,              FSCONTRACT  is inserted in this box. Service Contract Schedule Numbering Sequence : The numbering sequence           the system uses to assign identifiers to the service contract schedules created on the               ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) Service Contract Schedules (FS305100) form and route service contract           schedules created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) Route Service Contract Schedules (FS305600) form.

A variety of user interface improvements have been made in the 2019 R1 version of Acumatica ERP.
==Improved Lookup Boxes with Selector Buttons ==
On all Acumatica ERP forms, for lookup boxes having autocomplete functionality, the following improvements have been introduced. {br}

For faster loading of the list in the lookup table, only the first seven entries are displayed initially. If the number of entries exceeds seven, a scroll bar appears on the right (as shown in the previous screenshot). With the new dynamic scroll feature, the more entries are displayed by scrolling, the smaller the size of scroll bar cursor is. {br}

Now the user can also scroll the list by pressing the following keys: Page Up, Page Down, Up arrow, and Down arrow. For a list with a significant number of entries, the ''Prev'' and ''Next'' links have been removed. The whole list is displayed in one box that the user can scroll.{br}

All the previous functionality of the lookup boxes with lookup tables continues to be supported. {br}

The following screenshot shows an example of the autocomplete functionality with the user typing the <tt>ca</tt> character string. Notice that in the second and sixth results in the lookup table, you cannot see the ''ca'' character string highlighted in the displayed columns. This occurs because of insufficient size of visible area of the lookup table.[anchor|#_359fbdbc-6ece-4645-bb8c-7a7b70dfb93a][anchor|#_ff1b5864-7559-4288-b0ff-f1c8f500a4ae][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_UI_suggester.png|popup|Lookup table with highlighted entries|400px]
==Improvements to Search Relevance for Forms==
Usually users search the same word combinations to navigate to limited number of forms. This means that the user usually types the same search string and clicks the same specific menu item link that is displayed in the search results. To provide a more convenient user experience, the displaying of search results has been improved.{br}

Previously, the position of a menu item link in the search results did not depend on how often user followed this link. Now the more frequently the user clicks a specific link in the search results after entering a particular string, the higher the workspace containing this link will be displayed next time in the search results when this user enters this string.{br}

The following screenshots present an example of the search results before and after this improvement has been implemented. The user often searches ''Sales'', and the most-often-clicked menu item link is ''Sales Orders''.[anchor|#_047c9a32-9667-4c3f-95db-38d301766213][anchor|#_4df215f1-9f13-4ba5-843d-64b5f1c1221e][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_UI_ControlBefore.png|popup|Search results before improvement|400px][anchor|#_2244dbb3-d06b-4abc-8fc0-76a961d29b9f][anchor|#_1293ccf2-6c80-4aff-b515-159d5c04d9fb][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/RN_2019_R1_UI_ControlAfter.png|popup|Search results after improvement|400px]]]></column>

==Managing Prefixes for Objects of a Customization Project==
Developers can add a prefix that should be added to any object of the customization project. When validation of the customization project is performed, all objects are checked for the added prefix.{br}

To manage prefixes for a customization project, the developer should do the following:[anchor|#_d77e3c23-d3f9-49bc-801d-612bad6322c3]
#In the main menu of Customization Project Editor, select '''File &gt; Validate Project Prefix'''.
#:The '''Customization Project Prefix''' dialog box opens.
#In the '''Project Prefix''' field, add the prefix for the customization project. The prefix is a combination of two to four characters that can be any of the 26 Latin letters (A through Z).
#Click '''Save'''.
#:The developer can perform validation of the project&rsquo;s objects to check for the added prefix. To do this, in the '''Customization Project Prefix''' dialog box, click the '''Validate Project Items''' button. In the '''Validation Result''' area, the result of the validation appears. As an example, see the validation results in the screenshot below, where the ''CE'' prefix is added for the OnReleaseComplete project.[anchor|#_1d33e472-aafe-4b8f-a4fd-d19450908c78][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_ISVInitials.png|popup|The Customization Project Prefix dialog box|400px]

==Validating Data Consistency in Published Customization Projects==
Developers can verify the correspondence between the data types of DACs fields and field states generated by field attributes at run time. To perform this verification, the following options have been introduced:[anchor|#_e18c2fc0-4614-4a92-9b85-d852df7fd2cf]
*Verification that the data type of a DAC field matches with the field states generated at run time (the '''DAC Field Types''' menu command)
*Determination of whether there are any <tt>PXAttributeFamilyAttribute</tt> violations on a DAC field (the '''DAC Attributes''' menu command)
*Verification that DAC fields with lookup defined for a segmented key properly handle foreign key segments by means of <tt>PXDimensionAttribute</tt> (the '''Lookup Definitions''' menu command)

These menu commands are shown in the '''Validations''' menu of the Customization Projects (SM204505) form, as shown on the following screenshot.[anchor|#_ce5bc20e-08bb-47ee-af3c-cc302f1ecc84][anchor|#_dab35489-5dd7-4510-b539-68efa4c069fc][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_Validations.png|popup|DAC field validation options|200px][anchor|#_6baa4b1d-b768-4c43-8a98-06090ded85ed]
==Analyzing Custom Files Included in the Customization Project==
Developers can analyze custom files (assemblies) included in the customization project to verify that customization project doesn&rsquo;t replace or modify files distributed as part of the standard Acumatica ERP application. To do this, in the main menu of Customization Project Editor, the developer selects '''Extension Library &gt; Analyze Referenced Assemblies'''. A CSV is downloaded to the developer&rsquo;s computer with all references made in the project&rsquo;s custom files.[anchor|#_02fe7dbf-6100-4aa3-99bd-00ea16136c58]
==Generating an Excel Workbook==
To generate the workbook containing a list of the project&rsquo;s objects in Excel format, in the main menu of the Customization Project Editor, the developer should select '''File &gt; Export ISV Solution Objects Workbook'''. An XLSX file is automatically downloaded to the developer&rsquo;s computer.{br}

The generated workbook contains a list of solution objects and integration scenarios grouped by the following types:[anchor|#_b87ea2f3-ae9e-4b57-8801-c18baaaa5428]
*Site map nodes
*Mobile site map nodes

==Adding a User-Defined Field to the Customization Project==
A developer can choose which fields defined in an instance are included in the customization project and manage on which screens these fields are displayed.{br}

After users have defined some fields based on attributes, a developer opens the User-Defined Fields page of the Customization Project Editor. On this page, the developer loads the fields defined in the instance database or adds them manually by clicking the '''Add New Record''' button. An example of added user-defined fields is shown below.[anchor|#_3df17b84-b828-4965-915d-5f3ec35def76][anchor|#_3b42ed74-9f22-4cd1-9d52-5fdc006566a2][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_UserDefinedFieldsList.png|The list of user-defined fields|400px]
After the fields have been added, the developer can edit the list of forms on which each field is displayed. To do this, the developer clicks an attribute ID in the list. In the '''Edit Attribute''' dialog box (see the following screenshot), which opens, the developer selects the desired forms by selecting the unlabeled check boxes in the rows of the form IDs.

 Acumatica ERP 2019 R1 includes the fluent business query language (BQL), which is a new dialect of BQL that is more similar to SQL. Fluent BQL provides the following advantages as compared to the traditional BQL:[anchor|#_57390d3b-30e3-45d6-aab4-4c147575128f]
*It is easier to read and edit fluent BQL queries than traditional BQL queries because each section of a fluent BQL query does not depend on the others and can appear in only specific places of the query. Also, fluent BQL queries contain fewer commas and angle brackets and do not use numbered classes (such as <tt>Select2</tt> or <tt>Select6</tt>).
*A developer does not need to select a suitable class for the query (such as <tt>PXSelectOrderBy&lt;,&gt;</tt> or <tt>PXSelectJoinOrderBy&lt;,,&gt;</tt>); instead, the developer simply starts typing the command, and IntelliSense offers continuations that are relevant for the current query state.
{br}

The following example shows the declaration of the same data view in fluent BQL and in traditional BQL.<source lang="csharp">//Fluent BQL view declaration

Fluent BQL queries can be used instead of traditional BQL almost anywhere (such as in attributes, view declarations, and dynamic query building). However, fluent BQL cannot be used in the following cases:[anchor|#_d5d30fc7-ebad-40b0-96a5-0bbf568d75e9]
*When the query is supposed to be parsed and modified by the direct use of reflection— that is, not by <tt>BqlCommand.Decompose()</tt>, but by {{Type.GetGenericArguments()}}
*When it is necessary to use separate BQL components, such as <tt>Join</tt>, <tt>Where</tt>, <tt>Aggregate</tt>, <tt>OrderBy</tt>, and <tt>On</tt> clauses

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Platform API: Fluent Business Query Language  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1 includes the fluent business query language (BQL), which is a new dialect of BQL                 that is more similar to SQL. Fluent BQL provides the following advantages as                 compared to the traditional BQL: It is easier to read and edit fluent BQL queries than traditional BQL                         queries because each section of a fluent BQL query does not depend on the                         others and can appear in only specific places of the query. Also, fluent BQL                         queries contain fewer commas and angle brackets and do not use numbered                         classes (such as  Select2  or                          Select6 ). A developer does not need to select a suitable class for the query (such as                              PXSelectOrderBy<,>  or                              PXSelectJoinOrderBy<,,> ); instead, the developer                         simply starts typing the command, and IntelliSense offers continuations that                         are relevant for the current query state.

In Version 2019 R1, developers can write requests to the database by using language-integrated query (LINQ) expressions. This approach can be used to define a query in the application code or to filter the data resulting from a business query language (BQL) query. {br}

Developers can configure LINQ expressions in code by using any of the following variants of syntax:[anchor|#_aa67e1d7-ea84-436a-80b9-2065401cc8fa]
*A query expression, which is shown in the following code. <source lang="csharp">using PX.Data.SQLTree;
using System.Linq;

ProductMaint graph = PXGraph.CreateInstance&lt;ProductMaint&gt;();
var goods = from p in graph.Select&lt;Product&gt;()
  where 
    p.ProductCD.Length == 5 && 
    p.GroupMask.Length == 4 && 
    (p.WorkGroupID & 0b10) != 0
  select new 
  { 
    p.ProductID, 
    p.ProductCD, 
    p.ProductName, 
    Len = p.ProductName.Length, 
    BLen = SQL.BinaryLen( p.ProductName) + 1, 
    p.GroupMask, 
    p.WorkGroupID 
};</source>
*Explicit (method-based) syntax. The following code is equivalent to the query expression shown above.<source lang="csharp">using PX.Data.SQLTree;
using System.Linq;

ProductMaint graph = PXGraph.CreateInstance&lt;ProductMaint&gt;();
var goods = graph.Select&lt;Product&gt;()
  .Where( p =&gt; 
    p.ProductCD.Length == 5 && 
    p.GroupMask.Length == 4 && 
    (p.WorkGroupID & 0b10) != 0)
  .Select( p =&gt; new     
    { 
      p.ProductID, 
      p.ProductCD, 
      p.ProductName, 
      Len = p.ProductName.Length, 
      BLen = SQL.BinaryLen(p.ProductName) + 1, 
      p.GroupMask, p.WorkGroupID 
    });</source>
{br}

Because <tt>PXResultset&lt;T0&gt;</tt>, which is returned by the <tt>Select</tt> method of all <tt>PXSelect</tt> classes, now implements the {{IQueryable<PXResult<T0>>}} interface, developers can work with the data defined with a <tt>PXSelect</tt> query by using LINQ.

 Acumatica ERP 2019 R1 introduces a new UI of the processing pages, which is shown in the following screenshot. When a user starts a processing operation, the '''Processing''' dialog box opens, which displays the status of the processing. [anchor|#_3eb598c7-9893-4690-ad6b-9ec733e5745c][anchor|#_16cb9a41-e81c-4c1c-a8f1-3a0487a41f76][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_Platform_ProcessingPage.png|popup|The Processing dialog box|450px]{br}

When a processing operation is started, all elements of the processing page become unavailable. If a developer needs to enable a button from the processing page during processing, the developer has to add this button to the processing dialog box. A developer can also turn off the displaying of the processing dialog box and use the system behavior of Acumatica ERP 2018 R2.
==Adding a Button to the Processing Dialog Box==
To add a button to the processing dialog box, a developer can use one of the following approaches:[anchor|#_cd1c8262-e790-4132-a183-50626ddd46b2]
*For the action that corresponds to the button, in the graph, set the value of the <tt>VisibleOnProcessingResults</tt> property of <tt>PXButtonAttribute</tt> or its descendant to {{true}}, as shown in the following code example.<source lang="csharp">[PXUIField(DisplayName = Messages.ShowDocuments)]
[PXButton(VisibleOnProcessingResults = true)]
public virtual IEnumerable showDocuments(PXAdapter adapter)
{
    ShowOpenDocuments(SelectedItems);
    return adapter.Get();
}</source>
*In the ASPX file that corresponds to the page, set the value of the <tt>VisibleOnProcessingResults</tt> property of <tt>PXDSCallbackCommand</tt> to {{True}}, as shown in the following example.{{{{&lt;px:PXDataSource ID = "ds" Width="100%" 
    runat="server" Visible="True" PrimaryView="Filter" 
    TypeName="PX.Objects.FA.FAClosingProcess" &gt;
        &lt;CallbackCommands&gt;
            &lt;px:PXDSCallbackCommand Name = "showDocuments" 
                VisibleOnProcessingResults="True"/&gt;
        &lt;/CallbackCommands&gt; 
&lt;/px:PXDataSource&gt;
}}}}

==Turning Off the New UI of the Processing Pages==
To turn off the new UI of the processing pages, a developer can do one of the following:[anchor|#_5c6b21de-ed7b-4bb5-8e1a-fe5a5370f71c]
*To turn off the new UI for a particular page, override the <tt>IsProcessing</tt> property of the graph that corresponds to the page, as shown in the following code.<source lang="csharp">public override bool IsProcessing
{
    get { return false; }
    set { }
}</source>
*To turn off the new UI for all processing pages, add the <tt>ProcessingProgressDialog</tt> key in the {{appSettings}} section of the <tt>web.config</tt> file of the application, as shown in the following example.{{{{&lt;add key="ProcessingProgressDialog" value="false" /&gt;

Each Acumatica ERP license includes the limits on the number of web services API users, the number of concurrent API requests, and the number of web services API requests per minute. A developer can view the limits of the Acumatica ERP license on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_60_40_00|License Monitoring Console] ([~/?ScreenId=SM604000|SM604000]) form, which is shown in the following screenshot.

In Acumatica ERP 2018 R2, if any of these limits has been reached, the subsequent web services API request is declined. Acumatica ERP 2019 R1 processes the web services API requests differently. The following sections describe the changes in this processing.

==Number of Requests per Minute==
If the number of requests that have been processed in a particular minute reaches 50 percent of the limit specified for the license, the subsequent requests during this minute are delayed for the following time: 60 seconds minus the number of seconds that have passed since the beginning of the current minute, divided by the remaining number of requests that can be processed in the minute. {br}

For example, suppose that in a particular license, the limit of the number of web services API requests per minute is 50. Since the beginning of the current minute, if the system has already processed 25 requests in 40 seconds and the system receives another request, this request is delayed for {{(60-40)/(50-25)}} seconds. After the delay, the request will be processed.{br}

The request will be declined only if the number of requests that are waiting to be processed is greater than 20, or the request remains unprocessed for more than 10 minutes.{br}

A developer can view the statistics of the delayed and declined requests on the '''Statistics''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_60_40_00|License Monitoring Console] ([~/?ScreenId=SM604000|SM604000]) form, which is shown in the following screenshot.[anchor|#_ec44acfd-a0e7-4d18-9810-6391c2b245ad][anchor|#_178bbb8b-2283-4b7b-8ce8-1fcc784f20e0][image:ReleaseNotes/Images/2019R1_RN_Platform_RequestStatistics.png|popup|Statistics of the delayed and declined requests|450px]
==Number of Concurrent Requests==
If the limit for the number of concurrent web services API requests has been reached, the next concurrent request is processed when any of the previous requests has completed. {br}

The request will be declined only if the number of requests that are waiting to be processed is greater than 20, or the request remains unprocessed for more than 10 minutes.{br}

 Acumatica ERP 2019 R1 includes multiple improvements to credit card processing, which can be incorporated in custom credit card plug-ins. 
==Processing of Payments from New Credit Cards==
In previous versions of Acumatica ERP, to be able to accept payments from new credit cards, a user had to first define a customer payment profile for the customer with this credit card. In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, information about a new credit card can be entered when a user processes a payment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form. For details about this functionality, see [https://help-2019r1.acumatica.com/Help?ScreenId=ShowWiki&pageid=911fd540-85b5-4b0f-8b28-621cdd17fbcc|Finance: Ability to Process Payments from New Credit Cards].{br}

To implement the creation of a new credit card in a custom credit card plug-in, a developer needs add to the code of the plug-in the classes that implement the following interfaces: <tt>ICCProfileCreator</tt>, <tt>ICCTransactionGetter</tt>, and <tt>ICCHostedPaymentFormProcessor</tt>. 
==Synchronization of Credit Cards with the Processing Center==
 Acumatica ERP now supports the synchronization of credit cards registered in the Authorize.Net processing center with Acumatica ERP. A developer can implement the synchronization of credit cards registered in other processing centers with Acumatica ERP by adding the classes that implement the <tt>ICCTransactionGetter</tt> interface.
==Support of Webhooks==
 Acumatica ERP supports webhooks as a way to receive a response from the processing center. If a developer needs to use webhooks, the developer should add the classes that implement the <tt>ICCWebhookProcessor</tt> interface, which manages webhooks, and the <tt>ICCWebhookResolver</tt> interface, which parses the information that comes from the processing center through webhooks.{br}

This topic lists the minor improvements to Acumatica ERP that have not been described in the previous topics.
==Services==
'''AC-76810''': The UI of the calendar boards and maps has been improved for consistency with the rest of the Acumatica ERP UI. These improvements have not affected the functionality of the forms that include calendar boards and maps.{br}

'''AC-108556''': In previous versions of Acumatica ERP, for Avalara tax calculation, the system used the branch address as Address From and the customer location address as Address To. Now the improved way the system selects Address From and Address To works as follows:[anchor|#_dca2a16b-9ab3-41dd-89bd-243fc3e5f732]
*For the line items on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_01_00|Service Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_02_00|Appointments] ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) forms, the system uses the warehouse address (if applicable) or the branch location address of the service order (if no warehouse is applicable) as Address From. The system uses the service order address as Address To. 
*When a billing document (that is, an AR document, sales order, or SO invoice) is created from a service order or appointment, if a line item has been added to the service order or appointment, the sales taxes calculated in the service order or appointment are used in the billing document.

'''AC-110062''': In Acumatica ERP, a substitute form is a form that displays a list of the documents or entities that have been created by using a particular data entry form. The substitute form is opened when a user navigates to or searches for the entry form, and from the substitute form, the user can open any listed entity or create a new entity of the type on the data entry form. Each of the following forms now has a corresponding substitute form:[anchor|#_71c44824-dd3a-447b-a03d-5862e2c0c507]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_57_00|Service Contracts] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_51_00|Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100])

*[HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_48_00|Manufacturer Models] ([~/?ScreenId=FS204800|FS204800])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_49_00|Service Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=FS204900|FS204900])

*[HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_30_56_00|Route Service Contract Schedules] ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_36_00|Vehicles] ([~/?ScreenId=FS203600|FS203600])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\FS_20_42_00|Vehicle Types] ([~/?ScreenId=FS204200|FS204200])

==Organization==
'''AC-118831''': The out-of-the-box performance of the quick search functionality used on generic inquiry forms has been improved due to a reduced number of columns that are used in the quick search by default. If the check box is selected in the '''Use in Quick Search''' column on the '''Results Grid''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_80_00|Generic Inquiry] ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) form, the column is used in the search.{br}

'''AC-125402''': Now if a standard cost is specified for an expense non-stock item (that is, a non-stock item that represents a specific type of expense) on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form, the system inserts this cost by default for the expense item in the '''Unit Cost''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_20|Expense Receipt] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_10_00|Expense Claim] ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) forms, with respect to the effective date of the current standard cost—that is, for a document whose date is earlier than the effective date of the current cost, the system uses the last cost of the non-stock item as the default unit cost on the document entry form.{br}

'''AC-124868''': Because the '''Show Author’s Email Address''' check box on the '''General Settings''' tab of [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_10_10_00|Customer Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) form duplicated the logic that had been implemented on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_40_02|System Email Accounts] ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]) form, this check box has been removed.
==Mobile App==
'''AC-104606''': In the Acumatica mobile app, the mobile forms related to the Customer Management functionality, such as Contacts, Business Accounts, Opportunities, Cases, Task, Event, Email Activity, and Activity, have been significantly redesigned. Headers with most viewed information have been added. Location of fields on the mobile forms have been optimized for better usability. A new mobile form, Sales Quotes, have been added.
==Platform==
'''AC-64899''': On data entry forms, a user no longer has the ability to modify any details of a document while the system is running a long-run operation, such as the release of the document the user is working with. If the user changes the document while this processing is occurring and tries to save the changes, the system displays a warning message indicating that the changes have blocked and continues processing the operation involving the document.{br}

'''AC-95155''': Some elements of the user interface have been renamed. See the table below for more information.[anchor|#_899d0f1e-3be8-411c-ac13-338a588e55c4]

==Inventory and Order Management==
'''AC-39464''': In the table on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_50_30_00|Process Shipments] ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) form, a new '''Bill Separately''' column containing a check box has been added. If the check box in this column is selected in a particular row of the table (which represents a shipment), when the user runs the mass-processing of the selected shipments, the system will prepare a separate invoice for this shipment from the invoice of the other shipments to the same customer, if applicable.{br}

'''AC-96912''': On the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_10_00|Sales Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) form, the '''Amount''' column, which shows the amount of the document line after the application of discounts, has been added; this amount cannot be edited. The '''Ext. Price''' column on the same tab now shows the extended price, which is the unit price multiplied by the quantity; the extended price can be edited.{br}

'''AC-119342''': On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_15_00|Availability Calculation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) form, the '''Include Qty. on Returns''' check box has been renamed to '''Include Qty. on Sales Returns''' for clarity.{br}

'''AC-114220''': The new ''Completed'' status has been introduced for purchase orders on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. The system assigns this status to a purchase order that has been received in full but has not been billed in full—that is, if all purchase order lines on the '''Document Details''' tab have the '''Completed''' check box selected and at least one purchase order line still has the '''Closed''' check box cleared. (The system does not consider purchase order lines of the ''Description'' line type in assessing whether this status should be assigned; lines of this type are ignored.){br}

'''AC-124211''': The ''PX.StampsCarrier.StampsCarrier'' carrier plug-in has been improved. The plug-in now supports custom information for U.S. military mailing addresses and shipping to unincorporated U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam. Also, the ability to skip address verification has been implemented.

'''AC-110113''': On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_50_80_00|Print Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR508000|AR508000]) form, the '''Status''' column has been added, which gives users the ability to filter documents by their status (''Balanced'' or ''Released'').{br}

'''AC-41317''': On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_40_20_00|Customer Details] ([~/?ScreenId=AR402000|AR402000]) form, the '''Pay Invoice''' action (in the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar) has been renamed to '''Enter Payment/Apply Memo'''. Similarly, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_40_20_00|Vendor Details] ([~/?ScreenId=AP402000|AP402000]) form, the '''Pay Bill''' action (in the '''Actions''' menu on the form toolbar) has been renamed to '''Pay Bill/Apply Adjustment'''. If these actions are invoked for an unreleased, voided, or closed document, the system displays an error message; these actions can be invoked only if the document has the ''Open'' status. These enhancements make it more convenient for users to further process documents opened on these forms.{br}

'''AC-94388''': Small credit write-offs are now allowed directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) form. A user can perform a credit write-off if the payment amount is greater than the invoice amount. To do this, when creating a payment for an invoice, on the '''Documents to Apply''' tab, the user should enter a negative amount in the '''Balance Write-Off''' column and select the credit write-off reason code in the '''Write-Off Reason Code''' column. Users can also enter negative write-offs on the '''Applications''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_30_30_00|Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) forms.{br}

For example, if the invoice amount is $95 and the payment amount is $100, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_20_00|Payments and Applications] form, on the '''Documents to Apply''' tab, the user should enter <tt>100</tt> in the '''Amount Paid''' column and <tt>-5</tt> in the '''Balance Write-Off''' column to give both documents the ''Closed'' status after release. In this case, the system creates the following GL batch.[anchor|#table_kbx_jf4_rv]

'''AC-118997''': On the '''Commitments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]), a user can now select a purchase order line with the ''Completed'', ''Closed'', or ''Canceled'' status. If this line belongs to a purchase order with the ''Completed'', ''Closed'', or ''Canceled'' status, the purchase order can be reopened by means of change orders and will be assigned the ''Open'', ''Pending Printing'', or ''Pending Email'' status, depending on the purchase order workflow.{br}

'''AC-121502''': On the table toolbar of the '''Commitments''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]), a user can click '''Create Purchase Order''' and navigate to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) to create a new purchase order.{br}

'''AC-91883''': The '''Project''' box has been renamed to '''Project/Contract''' on the following forms:[anchor|#_da84ce04-659c-4032-87d8-086350a05756]

*The new {{BranchID}} key field has been added. The table now stores actual balances by financial period of the master calendar and by company-specific financial period, which is defined by the branch. Previously, balances were not broken down by branch in this table.
*The {{Tran*}} columns of the table contain values for master calendar financial periods.
*The {{Fin*}} columns of the table contain values for company-specific financial periods based on the {{PMTran.BranchID}} and {{PMTran.FinPeriodID}} data.

==Acumatica ERP Configuration Wizard==
'''AC-91152''': The'''Size''' box has been removed from the Acumatica ERP Configuration wizard on the database selection step if the system is being deployed on Azure.[anchor|#_a58a9bf5-fea5-48fc-b18e-deb14c71311c]
==Application Customization==
'''AC-118708''': The Acumatica Customization                         Engine now supports C# 7.0. Developers can use all features of C# 7.0 in customizations of Acumatica ERP.{br}

'''AC-118949''': The dashboard import and export scenarios have been improved, so that when a new dashboard is added to a customization project, all the included generic inquiries and wiki pages are also added or updated in the customization project. If any widget in the dashboard is linked to an Acumatica ERP form, the form is added or updated on the '''Site Map''' page of the [anchor|#_0f5e2c42-5fb0-435f-9c83-8cae1ee5e1f6]Customization Project Editor.{br}

'''AC-119313''': Now developers can use the <tt>RowPersisting</tt> and <tt>RowPersisted</tt> events and the <tt>InsertDocumentTransaction</tt>, <tt>InsertSplitTransaction</tt>, <tt>InsertRoundingTransaction</tt>, and <tt>InsertDepositChargeTransaction</tt> methods to customize the release of cash transactions.

'''AC-49767''': For the forms that have multiple dependent sets of detail lines, such as the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the performance of exporting data has been improved. For these forms, all of the following processes work faster: the copying and pasting of an entity on a form, the export of an entity in XML format, and the data retrieval through export scenarios, the web services APIs, and the mobile API.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Other Improvements This topic lists the minor improvements to  Acumatica ERP that have not been described in the previous topics. Services AC-76810 : The UI of the calendar boards and maps has been improved for consistency         with the rest of the  Acumatica ERP UI. These improvements have not affected the functionality of the forms that include         calendar boards and maps. AC-108556 : In previous versions of  Acumatica ERP, for Avalara tax calculation, the system used the branch address         as          Address From  and the customer location address as Address To. Now the         improved way the system selects Address From and Address To works as follows: For the line items on the   ([~/?ScreenId=FS300100|FS300100]) Service Orders (FS300100) and               ([~/?ScreenId=FS300200|FS300200]) Appointments (FS300200) forms, the system uses the           warehouse address (if applicable) or the branch location address of the service order (if           no warehouse is applicable) as Address From. The system uses the service order address as           Address To.  When a billing document (that is, an AR document, sales order, or SO invoice) is created           from a service order or appointment, if a line item has been added to the service order or           appointment, the sales taxes calculated in the service order or appointment are used in           the billing document. AC-110062 : In  Acumatica ERP, a  substitute form  is a form that displays a list of the documents or         entities that have been created by using a particular data entry form. The substitute form         is opened when a user navigates to or searches for the entry form, and from the substitute         form, the user can open any listed entity or create a new entity of the type on the data         entry form. Each of the following forms now has a corresponding substitute form:  ([~/?ScreenId=FS305700|FS305700]) Service Contracts (FS305700)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS305100|FS305100]) Service Contract Schedules (FS305100)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS204400|FS204400]) Manufacturers (FS204400)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS204800|FS204800]) Manufacturer Models (FS204800)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS204900|FS204900]) Service Templates (FS204900)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS204700|FS204700]) Master Contracts (FS204700)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS304000|FS304000]) Route Document Details (FS304000)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS203700|FS203700]) Routes (FS203700)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS300800|FS300800]) Route Service Contracts (FS300800)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS305600|FS305600]) Route Service Contract Schedules (FS305600)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS203600|FS203600]) Vehicles (FS203600)  ([~/?ScreenId=FS204200|FS204200]) Vehicle Types (FS204200) Organization AC-118831 : The out-of-the-box performance of the quick search functionality used on         generic inquiry forms has been improved due to a reduced number of columns that are used in         the quick search by default. If the check box is selected in the  Use in Quick           Search  column on the  Results Grid  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM208000|SM208000]) Generic Inquiry (SM208000) form, the column is used in the         search. AC-125402 : Now if a standard cost is specified for an expense non-stock item (that         is, a non-stock item that represents a specific type of expense) on the            Price/Cost Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form, the system inserts this cost by         default for the expense item in the  Unit Cost  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301020|EP301020]) Expense Receipt (EP301020) and   ([~/?ScreenId=EP301000|EP301000]) Expense Claim (EP301000) forms, with respect to the effective         date of the current standard cost—that is, for a document whose date is earlier than         the effective date of the current cost, the system uses the last cost of the non-stock item         as the default unit cost on the document entry form. AC-124868 : Because the  Show Author’s Email Address  check box         on the  General Settings  tab of   ([~/?ScreenId=CR101000|CR101000]) Customer Management Preferences (CR101000) form duplicated the logic that had been         implemented on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SM204002|SM204002]) System Email Accounts (SM204002) form, this check         box has been removed. Mobile App AC-104606 : In the  Acumatica         mobile app, the mobile forms related to the Customer Management functionality, such as         Contacts, Business Accounts, Opportunities, Cases, Task, Event, Email Activity, and         Activity, have been significantly redesigned. Headers with most viewed information have been         added. Location of fields on the mobile forms have been optimized for better usability. A         new mobile form, Sales Quotes, have been added. Platform AC-64899 : On data entry forms, a user no longer has the ability to modify any         details of a document while the system is running a long-run operation, such as the release         of the document the user is working with. If the user changes the document while this         processing is occurring and tries to save the changes, the system displays a warning message         indicating that the changes have blocked and continues processing the operation involving         the document. AC-95155 : Some elements of the user interface have been renamed. See the table below         for more information. Old Element Name New Element Name Location of the Element All Items Full Menu Name of the element displayed in the workspace title bar Help Articles Help Topics Name of the tab name in the Search Results window Exit Edit Menu Exit Menu Editing Mode Name of the button in Menu Editing mode Form Parameters Item Parameters Name of the dialog box that is opened when a user clicks                      Edit  on the form link Inventory and Order Management AC-39464 : In the table on the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO503000|SO503000]) Process Shipments         (SO503000) form, a new  Bill Separately  column containing a check box         has been added. If the check box in this column is selected in a particular row of the table         (which represents a shipment), when the user runs the mass-processing of the selected         shipments, the system will prepare a separate invoice for this shipment from the invoice of         the other shipments to the same customer, if applicable. AC-96912 : On the  Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000) form, the  Amount          column, which shows the amount of the document line after the application of discounts, has         been added; this amount cannot be edited. The  Ext. Price  column on         the same tab now shows the extended price, which is the unit price multiplied by the         quantity; the extended price can be edited. AC-119342 : On the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN201500|IN201500]) Availability Calculation Rules (IN201500) form, the            Include Qty. on Returns  check box has been renamed to            Include Qty. on Sales Returns  for clarity. AC-114220 : The new  Completed  status has been introduced for purchase orders         on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. The system assigns this         status to a purchase order that has been received in full but has not been billed in         full—that is, if all purchase order lines on the  Document           Details  tab have the  Completed  check box selected and         at least one purchase order line still has the  Closed  check box         cleared. (The system does not consider purchase order lines of the  Description  line         type in assessing whether this status should be assigned; lines of this type are         ignored.) AC-124211 : The  PX.StampsCarrier.StampsCarrier  carrier plug-in has been         improved. The plug-in now supports custom information for U.S. military mailing addresses         and shipping to unincorporated U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam. Also, the         ability to skip address verification has been implemented. Finance AC-110113 : On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR508000|AR508000]) Print Invoices and Memos (AR508000) form,          the            Status  column has been added, which gives users the ability to         filter documents by their status ( Balanced  or          Released ). AC-41317 : On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR402000|AR402000]) Customer Details (AR402000) form, the            Pay Invoice  action (in the  Actions  menu on         the form toolbar) has been renamed to  Enter Payment/Apply Memo .         Similarly, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AP402000|AP402000]) Vendor Details (AP402000) form, the            Pay Bill  action (in the  Actions  menu on the         form toolbar) has been renamed to  Pay Bill/Apply Adjustment . If these         actions are invoked for an unreleased, voided, or closed document, the system displays an         error message; these actions can be invoked only if the document has the  Open  status.         These enhancements make it more convenient for users to further process documents opened on         these forms. AC-94388 : Small credit write-offs are now allowed directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications (AR302000) form. A user can perform a credit         write-off if the payment amount is greater than the invoice amount. To do this, when         creating a payment for an invoice, on the  Documents to Apply  tab, the         user should enter a negative amount in the  Balance Write-Off  column         and select the credit write-off reason code in the  Write-Off Reason           Code  column. Users can also enter negative write-offs on the            Applications  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=SO303000|SO303000]) Invoices (SO303000) forms. For example, if the invoice amount is $95 and the payment amount is $100, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR302000|AR302000]) Payments and Applications form, on the  Documents to           Apply  tab, the user should enter  100  in the            Amount Paid  column and  -5  in the            Balance Write-Off  column to give both documents the  Closed          status after release. In this case,          the         system creates the following GL batch.  Account Debit Credit  Cash Account $100 $0 Accounts Receivable Account $0 $95 Other Income Account $0 $5 ($100 – $95) AC-122911 : On the   ([~/?ScreenId=TX503500|TX503500]) Recognize Input VAT (TX503500) and   ([~/?ScreenId=TX503000|TX503000]) Recognize Output VAT (TX503000) forms,  Acumatica ERP supports pending VAT recognized in AP and AR documents, respectively, with multiple         installment credit terms. Reporting AC-128772 : In  Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, support of project currency has been added to reports related to projects. The amounts         in the generated reports will be shown in the currency of the project. Projects AC-118997 : On the  Commitments  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000), a user can now select a purchase order         line with the  Completed ,  Closed , or  Canceled  status. If this line         belongs to a purchase order with the  Completed ,  Closed , or  Canceled          status, the purchase order can be reopened by means of change orders and will be assigned         the  Open ,  Pending Printing , or  Pending Email  status, depending on the         purchase order workflow. AC-121502 : On the table toolbar of the  Commitments  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000), a user can click            Create Purchase Order  and navigate to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) to create a new purchase order. AC-91883 : The  Project  box has been renamed to            Project/Contract  on the following forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=SO301000|SO301000]) Sales Orders (SO301000), in the Summary area  ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos (AR301000), in the Summary area  ([~/?ScreenId=DR201500|DR201500]) Deferral Schedule (DR201500), in the Summary area  ([~/?ScreenId=GL301000|GL301000]) Journal Transactions (GL301000), in the table AC-125440 : The  Internal Revenue Commitment Tracking  check box         has been hidden on the  General Settings  tab ( General           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences         (PM101000) form. The check box can be made visible by a simple customization project. AC-124055 : The  PMHistory  table has been changed as follows: The new  BranchID  key field has been added. The table now stores actual           balances by financial period of the master calendar and by company-specific financial           period, which is defined by the branch. Previously, balances were not broken down by           branch in this table. The  Tran*  columns of the table contain values for master calendar           financial periods. The  Fin*  columns of the table contain values for company-specific           financial periods based on the  PMTran.BranchID  and              PMTran.FinPeriodID  data. Acumatica ERP Configuration Wizard AC-91152 :  The Size  box          has been removed          from the Acumatica ERP          Configuration          w izard         on          the          database selection step          if         the system is being deployed  on Azure. Application Customization AC-118708 : The  Acumatica Customization                         Engine now supports C# 7.0. Developers can use all features of C# 7.0 in customizations                 of  Acumatica ERP. AC-118949 : The dashboard import and export scenarios have been improved, so that when a                 new dashboard is added to a customization project, all the included generic                 inquiries and wiki pages are also added or updated in the customization project. If                 any widget in the dashboard is linked to an  Acumatica ERP form, the form is added or updated on the  Site Map  page of                 the  Customization Project Editor . AC-119313 : Now developers can use the  RowPersisting  and                      RowPersisted  events and the                      InsertDocumentTransaction ,                      InsertSplitTransaction ,                      InsertRoundingTransaction , and                      InsertDepositChargeTransaction  methods to customize the                 release of cash transactions. For details about this approach, see  Customizing the Release Process for CA                     Documents Customizing the Release Process for CA Documents in the documentation. AC-127572 : The names of the customization projects that contain periods and brackets were                 imported incorrectly in the  Customization Project Editor. Now periods and brackets can be used in the names of customization projects. Platform API AC-115427 : The  Having<TCondition>  and                      Aggregate<TFunctions,THaving>  classes have been added to                 the business query language (BQL). The  Having<TCondition>                  class is equivalent to the SQL  HAVING  clause. In this class, you                 can specify the condition only by using fluent BQL.  AC-117732 : The  Power<Operand1, Operand2>  class, which is equivalent                 to the  POWER(Operand1, Operand2)  SQL function, has been added to                 BQL.  AC-118576 : Now it is possible to run a report with predefined report parameters                     ( Dictionary<string, strting> ) and data to be used for report                 generation ( PXResultSet ). To generate a report, a developer can                 use a  PXReportRedirectParameters  instance to pass the parameters                 and the data to a  PXReportRequiredException  instance.  Integration Development AC-49767 : For the forms that have multiple dependent sets of detail lines, such as the                       ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, the performance of                 exporting data has been improved. For these forms, all of the following processes                 work faster: the copying and pasting of an entity on a form, the export of an entity                 in XML format, and the data retrieval through export scenarios, the web services                 APIs, and the mobile API. ]]></column>
