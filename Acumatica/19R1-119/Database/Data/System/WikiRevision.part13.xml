			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
The Projects module helps you monitor and manage costs, revenues, and budget for projects. You can define projects and specify their settings, including defining tasks and populating projects with employees, resources, and equipment. By using the Projects module, you can manage projects of varying complexity across different project types and industries. {br}

The Projects module is seamlessly integrated with other Acumatica ERP modules, so you can automatically track project costs and budget and predict future revenue. Once you integrate the Projects module with another Acumatica ERP module, you can associate any document posted in the module with a specific project, which ensures that any project-related activity will be accounted for. You can integrate the Projects module with the General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Purchase Orders, Sales Orders, and Time and Expenses modules. {br}

You can use the Projects module to maintain complete, structured information about projects, including tracking their costs, budget, and expected revenues. In Acumatica ERP, a ''project'' is defined as a one-time effort planned for execution within specific time and cost limits, and with an expected budget and revenue. A project can consist of one task or multiple tasks, and you can associate individual projects and tasks with workgroups. {br}

The primary features of the Projects module are described briefly below and in more detail in other topics. {br}{TOC}
==Integration with Other Modules==
Integration between the Projects module and other Acumatica ERP modules makes it possible to maintain complete project information as the project-related data is entered into other modules: 
*Integration with the Accounts Payable, Purchase Orders, and Inventory modules gives users the ability to track costs and re-invoice them with or without a premium. This integration includes the following benefits:
**Integration with the Accounts Receivable and Sales Orders modules makes it easy to manage billing information.
**By using integration with the Time and Expenses module, managers can the track labor costs related to specific projects.

For more information, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Integration_With_Other_Modules|Integration with Other Modules].
==Labor Time and Cost Accounting==
 Acumatica ERP supports labor accounting through the attribution of labor hours to specific projects and tasks within projects. To this end, the time that employees spend on projects is recorded in time cards. The time-tracking information transparently flows in the Projects module. 
==Flexible Budget Tracking==
You can easily compare actual project costs with the original and revised budgets. As a project progresses, you can also continuously track budget execution, including whether actual costs match the budget, and act appropriately by either adjusting expenditures or revising the budget. In Acumatica ERP, you can also implement continuous budgeting. 
==Fixed-Price and Cost-Based Projects==
 Acumatica ERP supports two types of projects: fixed-price and cost-based. With fixed-price projects, the price for the project is defined at the beginning of the project and is not changed until the end of the project. With cost-based projects, the final price of the project depends on the overall cost of fulfilling the project, and the costs may be invoiced again with or without a premium. You can also run projects with a cap. 
==Work-in-Progress Accounting==
When maintaining project accounting in Acumatica ERP, you can track the work in progress (WIP) performed in the project. Work in progress is the amount of work that was performed but not yet invoiced. By using this functionality, you can use for billing only those project expenses that are relevant for specific billing periods.
==External and Internal Projects==
By using the Projects module, you can manage both external and internal projects. Generally, the scope of internal projects is limited to the physical and organizational boundaries of an organization; these projects serve the needs of the organization and never produce any revenue. On the other hand, an external project is revenue-driven, and the key objective is balancing costs and income to make sure the organization remains profitable, while meeting project goals and maximizing customer satisfaction. 
==Flexible Rate Calculation==
By using the flexible rate calculation engine in Acumatica ERP, you can implement complex pricing and accrual models that require the consideration of a large number of parameters. With this project management engine, you can differentiate rates depending on the project, task, account group, and employee class. You can even define different rates for specific dates or date ranges. 
==Billable Revenue Tracking==
You can track future revenues as a project progresses from task to task. By using Acumatica ERP, you can accommodate complex pricing models with a high level of granularity. 
==Templates for Projects and Tasks==
If your company routinely performs standardized projects (for instance, the building of standard houses), you do not need to create these projects from scratch and each time go through the entire procedure of defining a new project and its tasks. Instead, you can create templates for standard projects and tasks and use them each time you start a new project. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Templates_for_Projects_and_Tasks|Templates for Projects and Tasks].
==Commitment Tracking==
 Acumatica ERP supports tracking purchase orders and sales orders by project as the project cost commitments and project revenue commitments, respectively. These commitments affect the execution status of a project. A user can track the budget and actual amounts of a project, as well as the original commitments that remain open. 
==Draft Invoice Workflow==
You can enable draft invoices in the project billing workflow to work with a draft invoice that is isolated from the Accounts Receivable module. You can review and modify the draft invoice and reach agreement about the document with all required parties before the accounting team prepares the final Accounts Receivable invoice with all information copied from the draft invoice. With this process, the company can minimize corrections in the Accounts Receivable module. 
==Automated Project Billing and Invoicing==
As a project progresses from milestone to milestone or when it is completed, you can define the project to automatically generate billing information and generate invoices for customers. This saves time, reduces errors, and helps you improve the cash flow in your organization.
==Project Security==
 Acumatica ERP provides you with the variety of options that can be used to set up security of specific projects. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Project_Access|Project Security].]]></column>

This topic covers the prerequisites and preparatory steps needed before you begin configuring the Projects module.
==Prerequisites and Dependencies==[anchor|#ol_jgy_kxd_fm]
#The license for Acumatica ERP should include the Projects feature, and the feature should be enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. For details, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Managing_Features|Managing Features].
#The initial system configuration must be completed and the General Ledger module must be configured before you implement the Projects module. The Projects module can be tightly integrated with many Acumatica ERP modules, including General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Account Receivable, Inventory, Purchase Orders, Sales Orders, Time and Expenses, and Customer Management. These modules do not require any change in their configuration when Projects is implemented; however, the modules to be integrated with Projects should be implemented first.
#If you plan to track employee time spent on activities related to projects, make sure the ''Time Reporting on Activities'' feature is included in your license and enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. 
[anchor|#2]
==Preparation==
You should start the implementation of the Projects module with collecting and analyzing the necessary information. Perform the following steps before you actually configure the Projects module; these steps do not need to be done in the listed order and many can be done in parallel. ((({S:Hint}Because this is the preparation phase of implementation, enter no data into the system at this time.
)))[anchor|#table_yq3_2vh_vl]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="20%" ! Item 
!width="80%" ! Description
|- 
| '''Develop a naming convention for projects and tasks'''
|  Each project in Acumatica ERP is assigned a unique ''project ID''. Project identifiers can be comprised of segments with optional validation of each segment. Plan the structure of the project ID based on the segmented key ''PROJECT'': number of segments, length of segments, whether and how they should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used. Note that the ''PROJECT'' segmented key is also used for project templates, so decide whether you want the identifiers of projects to differ from the identifiers of templates. Prepare a list of valid entries for segments that should be validated. Design a numbering sequence for an auto-numbered segment, if one will be used. 
Plan also the structure for the identifiers of tasks (the segmented key ''PROTASK'').((({S:Hint} The task ID should be unique only within a project. Two different projects can have tasks with the same identifier, and they will be different tasks. For this reason, you should not use auto-numbering for task IDs.
))) For additional information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].
|- 
| '''Define non-project code'''
|  Once the Projects module is enabled, the system will require project IDs and project task IDs for every transaction in all the integrated modules of Acumatica ERP. This does not mean that each transaction must be linked to a project; the user can enter the non-project code (which you define) for a transaction that is not related to any project. For convenience, the non-project code should be distinctly different from project IDs and should be short, such as the single character ''X'', which is used by default.
|- 
| '''Define account groups'''
|  The role of ''account groups'' in Projects is similar to the role of accounts in General Ledger: All transaction processing and all reporting in Projects are done by using account groups. When defining account groups, first identify the accounts that will be used in project-related transactions. Accounts Receivable accounts (accounts debited by project billing) and Accounts Payable accounts (accounts credited by vendor bills) should be excluded. 
For each identified group, write down the following:[anchor|#ul_cy3_2vh_vl]
*A short '''Description''' of the account group.
* The '''Type''' of account group: ''Asset'', ''Liability'', ''Income'', ''Expense'', or ''Off-Balance''. The type of the group should be the same as the type of General Ledger accounts included in the group. An ''off-balance'' group cannot include any General Ledger account.
*The list of '''GL Accounts''' associated with the group.
* The '''Account Group ID''' (which should comply with the ''ACCGROUP'' segmented key).
For details, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]).
|- 
| '''Develop a naming convention for account groups'''
|  Plan the structure of identifiers to be used for account groups. The structure is defined by the ''ACCGROUP'' segmented key. The account group identifiers can mimic the GL account numbers or be text identifiers, such as ''BUDGET'', ''REVENUE'', and ''EXPENSE''. If needed, the identifiers can be defined with multiple segments. Use similar identifiers for similar account groups to be able to specify ranges of account groups (arranged alphabetically) when defining allocation rules.
|- 
| '''Plan labor items'''
|  Labor items provide information on hourly rates, GL accounts, and tax categories to be used to account for labor on projects. ((({S:Hint}The GL accounts used for labor items should be mapped to appropriate account groups; otherwise, the transactions related to labor on projects will not be visible in the Projects module. 
)))Decide what different types of labor are involved with projects and how they differ (thus, how their settings will differ). Decide how many labor items you will need for these types of labor. 
|- 
| '''Create a list of non-stock items to be used in projects'''
| Write down all non-stock items to denote services, miscellaneous expenditures that may be used for projects, and various types of labor. Select the GL accounts to be used for those items and note that the accounts should be mapped to the defined account groups. For details, see the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form.
|- 
| '''Define equipment to be used for projects'''
| If you plan to use specific equipment for projects, write it down on the list. For each piece of equipment, specify runtime, suspend, and setup rates and respective rate items. Also, write down the accounts (and subaccounts) to be used to record costs of using the equipment for projects; map the accounts to appropriate account groups.
|- 
| '''Plan reason codes'''
| To issue a stock item from a warehouse for a project, you have to specify a reason code that would provide appropriate accounts for the transaction. The accounts specified for the reason codes should be mapped to appropriate account groups. For details, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_21_10_00|Reason Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]). 
|- 
| '''Plan attributes'''
| Attributes can be used to store additional information about projects. You can define the types of UI controls to be used for attributes and the lists of possible values; you can even make them required elements on the forms. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Attributes_and_User_Defined_Fields|Managing Attributes and User-Defined Fields].
|- 
| '''Plan on integrating Projects with other modules'''
| The Projects module can be integrated with the General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Order Management, Purchase Orders, Organization Structure, Inventory, Cash Management, and Customer Management modules. Integration with a specific module means that projects are visible in this module, and the users can enter project-related transactions in this module. 
Particular projects and their tasks can have their own (more narrow) visibility scopes. ((({S:Hint} Whether or not the Projects module is integrated with the General Ledger and Accounts Receivable modules, the system will post the Projects transactions to the General Ledger module and generate Accounts Receivable invoices.
)))
|- 
| '''Define integration with Time and Expenses'''
|  If you are going to track the time your employees work on specific projects or bill customers for equipment involved in projects, integrate the Projects module with the Time and Expenses module. With this integration, the Time and Expenses module will initially release the employee and equipment time cards to the Projects module; then, on allocation, the Projects module will post them to General Ledger. 
|- 
| '''Decide whether you need to track time on activities'''
| Enabling the ''Time Reporting on Activities'' feature will allow you to track the work time and overtime your employees spend on the activities related to projects. This feature should be included in your license. Also, plan the activity types for which you want to track time. 
|- 
| '''Create a list of employees who will work for projects'''
| Make sure that all the employees who will work for projects have employee and user accounts; also, make sure that their hourly rates are specified and the appropriate labor items are defined.
|- 
| '''Design roles'''
| Design the roles you need for users who will configure rate tables, set up allocation and billing rules, manage projects, and enter the data for projects.
|- 
| colspan="2" | The steps below can be done later when you will be configuring project templates or creating particular projects.
|- 
| '''Define @Rates (Rate Tables)'''
|  In Projects, ''@Rate'' is a parameter used in formulas of the allocation and billing rules. Different rates can be applied to different transactions based on many related factors, such as particular tasks or projects, account groups, equipment used, inventory items involved, particular employees participating, and the particular step of the allocation or billing. For example, you can charge customers for consultant work differently depending on the particular consultant involved in a project.((({S:Hint}
Do not confuse the term ''rate'' in rate tables with other rates in Acumatica ERP, such as employee hourly rates or equipment run rates. In the context of rate tables, ''rate'' is a number (''@Rate'') that you can use in allocation rules as a multiplier, an addend, or a constant value. For instance, to implement a price model that estimates the project price as total costs plus 10 percent, you can define a ''@Rate'' of 1.1 in the appropriate rate table and calculate the project price as the total cost multiplied by this rate.
)))
For more information on rates, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Rate_Codes_and_Pricing_Rates|Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples] and [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__how_to_Configure_Rate_Table|To Configure a Rate Table].{br}

Write down the rates to be used for different sets of factors.
|- 
| '''Define earning types'''
| You will need non-stock items to account for labor on projects. You can define earning types on a per-project basis.
|- 
| '''Design allocation rules'''
|  Allocation rules define how to:[anchor|#ul_uz3_2vh_vl]
*Re-allocate costs between account categories, tasks, and projects.
*Calculate burdens, overheads, unbilled, and unearned revenues.
*Select and group transactions for posting.
*Calculate billable amounts and generate Accounts Receivable invoices.
 Analyze your business needs and practices and design your own allocation rules. For further details, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]).
|- 
| '''Design billing rules'''
| Billing rules define how to bill the customers for work performed by your company on specific projects. For further details, see [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]).
|- 
| '''Consider creating templates for projects and tasks'''
|  Review the planned projects, group them by similar properties, and decide on creating project templates. Review the project tasks, and write down a list of the tasks that are common for most projects (common tasks). Also, create the lists of tasks specific for each group of projects—you will include them in respective project templates.

For details, see  Managing Features. The initial system configuration must be completed and the General Ledger module must be           configured before you implement the Projects module. The Projects module can be tightly           integrated with many  Acumatica ERP modules, including General Ledger, Accounts Payable, Account Receivable, Inventory,           Purchase Orders, Sales Orders, Time and Expenses, and Customer Management. These modules           do not require any change in their configuration when Projects is implemented; however,           the modules to be integrated with Projects should be implemented first. If you plan to track employee time spent on activities related to projects, make sure           the  Time Reporting on Activities  feature is included in your license and enabled on           the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form.  Preparation You should start the implementation of the Projects module with collecting and analyzing         the necessary information. Perform the following steps before you actually configure the         Projects module; these steps do not need to be done in the listed order and many can be done         in parallel.  Because this is the preparation phase of implementation, enter no data into the system         at this time. Item  Description Develop a naming convention for projects and tasks  Each project in  Acumatica ERP is assigned a unique  project ID . Project identifiers can be comprised of                 segments with optional validation of each segment. Plan the structure of the project                 ID based on the segmented key  PROJECT : number of segments, length of                 segments, whether and how they should be validated, and whether auto-numbering                 should be used. Note that the  PROJECT  segmented key is also used for project                 templates, so decide whether you want the identifiers of projects to differ from the                 identifiers of templates. Prepare a list of valid entries for segments that should                 be validated. Design a numbering sequence for an auto-numbered segment, if one will                 be used.  Plan also the structure for the identifiers of tasks (the segmented key                      PROTASK ).  The task ID should be unique only within                   a project. Two different projects can have tasks with the same identifier, and                   they will be different tasks. For this reason, you should not use auto-numbering                   for task IDs.  For additional information, see  Segmented Identifiers. Define non-project code  Once the Projects module is enabled, the system will require project IDs and                 project task IDs for every transaction in all the integrated modules of  Acumatica ERP. This does not mean that each transaction must be linked to a project; the user                 can enter the non-project code (which you define) for a transaction that is not                 related to any project. For convenience, the non-project code should be distinctly                 different from project IDs and should be short, such as the single character                    X , which is used by default. Define account groups  The role of  account groups  in Projects is similar to the role of                 accounts in General Ledger: All transaction processing and all reporting in Projects                 are done by using account groups. When defining account groups, first identify the                 accounts that will be used in project-related transactions. Accounts Receivable                 accounts (accounts debited by project billing) and Accounts Payable accounts                 (accounts credited by vendor bills) should be excluded.  For each identified                   group, write down the following: A short  Description  of the account group.  The  Type  of account group:  Asset ,  Liability ,                          Income ,  Expense , or  Off-Balance . The type of the group                       should be the same as the type of General Ledger accounts included in the                       group. An  off-balance  group cannot include any General Ledger                       account. The list of  GL Accounts  associated with the group.  The  Account Group ID  (which should comply with the  ACCGROUP                        segmented key). For details, see   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups                   (PM201000). Develop a naming convention for account groups  Plan the structure of identifiers to be used for account groups. The structure                 is defined by the  ACCGROUP  segmented key. The account group identifiers can                 mimic the GL account numbers or be text identifiers, such as  BUDGET ,                    REVENUE , and  EXPENSE . If needed, the identifiers can be defined with                 multiple segments. Use similar identifiers for similar account groups to be able to                 specify ranges of account groups (arranged alphabetically) when defining allocation                 rules. Plan labor items  Labor items provide information on hourly rates, GL accounts, and tax                 categories to be used to account for labor on projects.  The GL accounts used                   for labor items should be mapped to appropriate account groups; otherwise, the                   transactions related to labor on projects will not be visible in the Projects                   module.  Decide what different types of labor are involved with projects and                 how they differ (thus, how their settings will differ). Decide how many labor items                 you will need for these types of labor.  Create a list of non-stock items to be used in projects Write down all non-stock items to denote services, miscellaneous expenditures                 that may be used for projects, and various types of labor. Select the GL accounts to                 be used for those items and note that the accounts should be mapped to the defined                 account groups. For details, see the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000)                 form. Define equipment to be used for projects If you plan to use specific equipment for projects, write it down on the list.                 For each piece of equipment, specify runtime, suspend, and setup rates and                 respective rate items. Also, write down the accounts (and subaccounts) to be used to                 record costs of using the equipment for projects; map the accounts to appropriate                 account groups. Plan reason codes To issue a stock item from a warehouse for a project, you have to specify a                 reason code that would provide appropriate accounts for the transaction. The                 accounts specified for the reason codes should be mapped to appropriate account                 groups. For details, see   ([~/?ScreenId=CS211000|CS211000]) Reason Codes (CS211000).  Plan attributes Attributes can be used to store additional information about projects. You can                 define the types of UI controls to be used for attributes and the lists of possible                 values; you can even make them required elements on the forms. For more information,                 see  Managing Attributes and User-Defined Fields. Plan on integrating Projects with other modules The Projects module can be integrated with the General Ledger, Accounts                 Payable, Accounts Receivable, Order Management, Purchase Orders, Organization                 Structure, Inventory, Cash Management, and Customer Management modules. Integration                 with a specific module means that projects are visible in this module, and the users                 can enter project-related transactions in this module.  Particular projects and                   their tasks can have their own (more narrow) visibility scopes.   Whether or not the Projects module is integrated with the General                   Ledger and Accounts Receivable modules, the system will post the Projects                   transactions to the General Ledger module and generate Accounts Receivable                   invoices. Define integration with Time and Expenses  If you are going to track the time your employees work on specific projects or                 bill customers for equipment involved in projects, integrate the Projects module                 with the Time and Expenses module. With this integration, the Time and Expenses                 module will initially release the employee and equipment time cards to the Projects                 module; then, on allocation, the Projects module will post them to General Ledger.                Decide whether you need to track time on activities Enabling the  Time Reporting on Activities  feature will allow you to                 track the work time and overtime your employees spend on the activities related to                 projects. This feature should be included in your license. Also, plan the activity                 types for which you want to track time.  Create a list of employees who will work for projects Make sure that all the employees who will work for projects have employee and                 user accounts; also, make sure that their hourly rates are specified and the                 appropriate labor items are defined. Design roles Design the roles you need for users who will configure rate tables, set up                 allocation and billing rules, manage projects, and enter the data for                 projects. The steps below can be done later when you will be                 configuring project templates or creating particular projects. Define @Rates (Rate Tables)  In Projects,  @Rate  is a parameter used in formulas of the allocation                 and billing rules. Different rates can be applied to different transactions based on                 many related factors, such as particular tasks or projects, account groups,                 equipment used, inventory items involved, particular employees participating, and                 the particular step of the allocation or billing. For example, you can charge                 customers for consultant work differently depending on the particular consultant                 involved in a project. Do not confuse the term  rate  in rate tables with other rates in  Acumatica ERP, such as employee hourly rates or equipment run rates. In the context of rate                     tables,  rate  is a number ( @Rate ) that you can use in                     allocation rules as a multiplier, an addend, or a constant value. For instance,                     to implement a price model that estimates the project price as total costs plus                     10 percent, you can define a  @Rate  of 1.1 in the appropriate rate table                     and calculate the project price as the total cost multiplied by this rate. For more information on rates, see  Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples and  To Configure a Rate Table. Write down the rates to be                   used for different sets of factors. Define earning types You will need non-stock items to account for labor on projects. You can define                 earning types on a per-project basis. Design allocation rules  Allocation rules define how to: Re-allocate costs between account categories, tasks, and projects. Calculate burdens, overheads, unbilled, and unearned revenues. Select and group transactions for posting. Calculate billable amounts and generate Accounts Receivable invoices.  Analyze your business needs and practices and design your own allocation                 rules. For further details, see   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules                 (PM207500). Design billing rules Billing rules define how to bill the customers for work performed by your                 company on specific projects. For further details, see   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000). Consider creating templates for projects and tasks  Review the planned projects, group them by similar properties, and decide on                 creating project templates. Review the project tasks, and write down a list of the                 tasks that are common for most projects (common tasks). Also, create the lists of                 tasks specific for each group of projects—you will include them in respective                 project templates. ]]></column>

Rates are date-sensitive.                   You can define date ranges when one rate supersedes another. However, for the                   purpose of implementation, all rates should have the start date as the first                   operational date of the Projects module and a blank end date. 12 Create allocation rules  Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules (PM207500) form to create the rules for                 project allocation.  13 Create billing rules  Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form to create the rules                 for project billing.  14 Create project templates  Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form to create project                 templates.  15 Create template tasks and common tasks  Use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) Project Template Tasks (PM208010) form to create template  tasks                 and the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) Common Tasks (PM208030) form to create common tasks.  ]]></column>

You can seamlessly integrate the Projects module with other modules of Acumatica ERP. With this integration, information about transactions related to projects can transparently flow into the Projects module and be available for tracking budget, costs, and future revenue for projects. {br}

You can integrate the Projects module with the following modules: 
*General Ledger
*Accounts Payable
*Inventory
*Accounts Receivable
*Sales Orders
*Purchase Orders
*Time and Expenses
{br}{TOC}
==Visibility Settings==
If you integrate the Projects module with other modules, the active projects defined in the Projects module become visible in those modules. All data entry forms of any integrated module include two additional elements—'''Project ''' and '''Task'''. Each time you enter a transaction that relates to a specific active project in the Projects module, you can associate the transaction with this project by selecting the appropriate project and task. 
==Non-Project Code==
The non-project code, which is specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, is a code that you can use to indicate that specific transactions are not associated with any project. By default, this code is ''X'', but you can specify a different non-project code. {br}

Once you activate the Projects module and integrate another Acumatica ERP module with it, users must specify '''Project''' and '''Task''' values when they enter transactions on the data entry forms of that module. If a user does not want to associate a particular transaction with any project, the user must select the non-project code as the '''Project'''. With this code selected, no information will be transferred to the Projects module and no project balances will be updated. 
==Integration with the General Ledger Module==
 With the integration between the Projects and General Ledger modules, in the General Ledger module, you can directly enter transactions related to specific project tasks.((({S:Hint}If you plan on integrating the Projects module with any of the Acumatica ERP modules, we recommend that you integrate it with the General Ledger module too.
)))
Even if the Projects module is not integrated with the General Ledger module, by using account groups that are mapped to GL accounts, you will be able to view the transactions that are generated in other integrated modules and eventually posted to General Ledger. 
==Integration with Accounts Payable, Inventory, and Purchase Orders==
When you integrate the Projects module with the Accounts Payable, Inventory, and Purchase Orders modules, the mandatory '''Project''' and '''Task''' columns are added to data entry forms in the integrated module so that purchases of stock items, non-stock items, and services can be associated with specific project tasks, as can inventory transactions. Each time a user enters a document in any of these modules, the user must either specify the project and task to associate with the current transaction or select the non-project code. {br}

Integrated modules do not post transactions to Projects directly. A transaction originating in the Purchase Orders module, on release, generates transactions in the Inventory module and in the Accounts Payable module. The transactions related to projects in the Accounts Payable and Inventory modules are first released and then posted to the General Ledger module; then from the General Ledger module, they are copied to the Projects module. You can reduce the time required for processing transactions by configuring integrated modules in the following ways: [anchor|#ul_zsm_1pq_fm]
*Select the '''Release AP Documents Automatically''' and '''Release IN Documents Automatically''' check boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_10_10_00|Purchase Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PO101000|PO101000]) form.
*Select the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check boxes on the following forms: [HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]).

To update the General Ledger module with the full details of the original transactions, clear the '''Post Summary on Updating GL''' check boxes on the following forms: [anchor|#ul_emb_2nq_fm]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AP_10_10_00|Accounts Payable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AP101000|AP101000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000])

==Integration with the Accounts Receivable and Sales Orders Modules==
When you integrate the Projects module with the Sales Orders and Accounts Receivable module, on the forms of these modules, the '''Project''' box is added to the Summary area and the '''Task''' column is added to the Details area. If a user selects a specific project, the user must also specify a particular task of this project. {br}

Transactions originating in the Sales Order module, on release, generate transactions in the Inventory and Accounts Receivables modules. The Accounts Receivable and Inventory modules do not post transactions to Projects directly. The original transaction is first released and then posted to General Ledger, and then from General Ledger it is copied to the Projects module. You can reduce the time required for the processing of transactions by configuring the integrated modules as follows:[anchor|#ul_srm_5xq_fm]
*Select the '''Release IN Documents Automatically''' option on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SO_10_10_00|Sales Orders Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=SO101000|SO101000]) form.
* Select the '''Automatically Post on Release''' check boxes on both the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) forms. 

To update the Projects module with the full details of the original transactions, clear the '''Post Summary on Updating GL''' check boxes on the following forms: [anchor|#ul_ncm_gyq_fm]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000])
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_10_10_00|Inventory Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=IN101000|IN101000])

==Integration with the Time and Expenses Module==
When you integrate the Projects module with the Time and Expenses module, the '''Project''' and '''Task''' columns are added on all data entry forms. These columns are mandatory. {br}

If your employees work on projects managed by using the Projects module, you can use the Time and Expenses module to track the time they spend on projects, including regular time and overtime. By default, you use time cards for this purpose, but you can instead use expense claims. {br}

Once released, a time card or an expense claim associated with a specific project does not directly generate General Ledger transactions; instead, Acumatica ERP generates one or more transactions in the Projects module. By using the options located on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form, you can select whether the transactions from the Projects module will be posted to an account group of the ''Off-Balance'' type or to account groups of standard types: ''Asset'', ''Liability'', ''Expense'', and ''Income''. The General Ledger will be updated through the transactions generated based on the transactions posted to account groups of standard types.{br}

To reduce the time required for transaction processing, select the '''Automatically Release PM Documents''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] form. ((({S:Hint}In the Time and Expenses module, notes and attached documents from a Time and Expenses transaction can be copied to a Projects transaction if the '''Copy Files to PM Documents''' and '''Copy Notes to PM Documents''' check boxes on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] form are selected.
)))
You can use expense claims to track the expenses your employees incur when they work on specific projects. Once released, an expense claim associated with a specific project does not generate Accounts Receivable transactions; instead, Acumatica ERP generates transactions in the Projects module that, in turn, will generate the Account Receivable transactions. {br}

If equipment is used in projects managed by using the Projects module, you can use the Time and Expenses module to track the time the equipment was used for projects, including run time, standby time, and suspend time. Once released, a time card associated with a specific project does not generate General Ledger transactions. Instead, Acumatica ERP generates transactions in the Projects module.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
An ''account group'' is an entity in Acumatica ERP that you can define by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form and map to a subset of General Ledger accounts. In projects, the account group plays the same role as the General Ledger accounts do in the General Ledger ledger: it is used to track the project budget and balances.{br}

Account groups facilitate aggregation, tracking, control, and management of information related to the project budget, costs, and future revenues. Because they are mapped to General Ledger accounts, account groups provide transfer of the project-related financial information between the General Ledger and Projects modules. For instance, on the '''Balances''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can view the budget, revised budget, and actual balance of each account group in the selected project. {br}{TOC}
==Account Group Identifiers==
To configure the identifiers of account groups in Acumatica ERP, you use the ''ACCGROUP'' segmented key on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. By default, this segmented key specifies that the account group identifier is an alphanumeric string of up to 10 characters. If needed, you can divide account group identifiers into segments with specific values. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers]. In most cases, you do not need to change the default configuration of the ''ACCGROUP'' key. {br}

For clarity, we recommend that you assign user-friendly identifiers to account groups. For instance, you can use ''LABOR'' as the name of the account group to track labor costs or ''TRAVEL'' as the name of the account group to track travel costs. 
==Types of Account Groups==
An account group can belong to one of the following types: ''Asset'', ''Liability'', ''Expense'', or ''Income''. An account group of a particular type can be mapped to specific General Ledger accounts of only certain types—that is, an account group of the ''Asset'' or ''Liability'' type may include only asset and liability accounts, an account group of the ''Income'' or ''Expense'' type may include accounts of any type.{br}

You can use account groups of the ''Off-Balance'' type to collect and track for projects statistical and other information that is unrelated to finance. Account groups of the ''Off-Balance'' type are not mapped to any General Ledger accounts. The transactions posted to account groups of this type will not update the General Ledger. For example, you can create an off-balance group to record all work hours spent by employees on the project. You may want to know the total of work hours, but you do not want to post those amounts to General Ledger. 
==Account Groups and General Ledger==
You can create account groups to be used in the Projects module by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form. When you define account groups, first identify the accounts that will be used in project-related transactions. ((({S:Hint}Accounts Receivable accounts (accounts debited by project billing) and Accounts Payable accounts (accounts credited by vendor bills) should be excluded.
)))
Use the following rules to create account groups:[anchor|#ul_tx3_2vh_vl]
*Any single account group may include one or more General Ledger accounts; however, you cannot map any General Ledger account to more than one account group. 
*An account group should include accounts of only certain types (for instance, an account group of the ''Liability'' type may include only asset and liability accounts).
*When you map the accounts to account groups, consider the billing and allocation rules. For billing and allocation, if the transactions of two accounts should be processed differently, these two accounts should be included in different account groups. If the transactions usually use the same rate, consider including their accounts in one group. If for specific transactions usually different rates are used, consider including their accounts in different groups.
*Consider whether you need the ''Off-balance'' account groups that are not linked to General Ledger accounts and that would hold amounts not posted to General Ledger. For information about using account groups in this way, see the examples of allocation and billing rules further in the article. 

By using account groups, you can view specific balances by project. For example, the ''EXPENSE'' account group was created for customization projects and includes the following accounts: [anchor|#ul_vkf_43p_vl]
*4010 Travel Expenses
*4030 Accommodation
*4050 Car Rent
*4113 Office Supplies
*4115 Miscellaneous Expenses

As the customization group arrives to the client location and the employees start working on the customization project, they record their expenditures related to the project to appropriate General Ledger accounts. The project manager can view the project&rsquo;s expenses as the balance of the ''EXPENSE'' account group, which is the total of all expenses recorded to all the expense accounts included in the ''EXPENSE'' account group.
==Account-Task Mapping for Automatically Added Transactions==
When you create a document, you specify a project task for each transaction where it is applicable. For an automatically added transaction, however, there is no project task specified, and this causes an error. For instance, the system can add a freight transaction for an AR invoice. {br}

You have to provide mapping for the accounts that may be automatically added to project in the '''Default Task for GL Account''' table on the '''GL Accounts''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the same mapping should be used for multiple similar projects, specify the rules by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form.
==Attributes for Account Groups==
You can create attributes to store additional properties of account groups that can be used in billing and in allocations. You can create attributes by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form, and by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_20_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000]) form, you can specify which of the attributes can be assigned to account groups. To assign attributes to a specific account group, use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_10_00|Account Groups] ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) form.{br}

For more information on using attributes in projects, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Attributes_and_User_Defined_Fields|Managing Attributes and User-Defined Fields].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Account Groups in Projects An  account group  is an entity in  Acumatica ERP that you can define by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups                 (PM201000) form and map to a subset of General Ledger accounts. In projects, the                 account group plays the same role as the General Ledger accounts do in the General                 Ledger ledger: it is used to track the project budget and balances. Account groups facilitate aggregation, tracking, control, and management of                 information related to the project budget, costs, and future revenues. Because they                 are mapped to General Ledger accounts, account groups provide transfer of the                 project-related financial information between the General Ledger and Projects                 modules. For instance, on the  Balances  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, you can view the                 budget, revised budget, and actual balance of each account group in the selected                 project.  Account Group Identifiers To configure the identifiers of account groups in  Acumatica ERP, you use the  ACCGROUP  segmented key on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) Segmented Keys                 (CS202000) form. By default, this segmented key specifies that the account group                 identifier is an alphanumeric string of up to 10 characters. If needed, you can                 divide account group identifiers into segments with specific values. For more                 information, see  Segmented Identifiers. In most cases,                 you do not need to change the default configuration of the  ACCGROUP  key.  For clarity, we recommend that you assign user-friendly identifiers to account                 groups. For instance, you can use  LABOR  as the name of the account group to                 track labor costs or  TRAVEL  as the name of the account group to track travel                 costs.  Types of Account Groups An account group can belong to one of the following types:  Asset ,                      Liability ,  Expense , or  Income . An account group of a                 particular type can be mapped to specific General Ledger accounts of only certain                 types—that is, an account group of the  Asset  or  Liability  type                 may include only asset and liability accounts, an account group of the  Income                  or  Expense  type may include accounts of any type. You can use account groups of the  Off-Balance  type to collect and track for                 projects statistical and other information that is unrelated to finance. Account                 groups of the  Off-Balance  type are not mapped to any General Ledger accounts.                 The transactions posted to account groups of this type will not update the General                 Ledger. For example, you can create an off-balance group to record all work hours                 spent by employees on the project. You may want to know the total of work hours, but                 you do not want to post those amounts to General Ledger.  Account Groups and General Ledger You can create account groups to be used in the Projects module by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form. When you define account groups, first                 identify the accounts that will be used in project-related transactions.  Accounts Receivable accounts (accounts debited by project billing) and Accounts                 Payable accounts (accounts credited by vendor bills) should be excluded. Use the following rules to create account groups: Any single account group may include one or more General Ledger accounts;                     however, you cannot map any General Ledger account to more than one account                     group.  An account group should include accounts of only certain types (for instance, an                     account group of the  Liability  type may include only asset and liability                     accounts). When you map the accounts to account groups, consider the billing and allocation                     rules. For billing and allocation, if the transactions of two accounts should be                     processed differently, these two accounts should be included in different                     account groups. If the transactions usually use the same rate, consider                     including their accounts in one group. If for specific transactions usually                     different rates are used, consider including their accounts in different                     groups. Consider whether you need the  Off-balance  account groups that are not                     linked to General Ledger accounts and that would hold amounts not posted to                     General Ledger. For information about using account groups in this way, see the                     examples of allocation and billing rules further in the article.  By using account groups, you can view specific balances by project. For example, the                      EXPENSE  account group was created for customization projects and includes                 the following accounts:  4010 Travel Expenses 4030 Accommodation 4050 Car Rent 4113 Office Supplies 4115 Miscellaneous Expenses As the customization group arrives to the client location and the employees start                 working on the customization project, they record their expenditures related to the                 project to appropriate General Ledger accounts. The project manager can view the                 project's expenses as the balance of the  EXPENSE  account group, which is the                 total of all expenses recorded to all the expense accounts included in the                      EXPENSE  account group. Account-Task Mapping for Automatically Added Transactions When you create a document, you specify a project task for each transaction where it                 is applicable. For an automatically added transaction, however, there is no project                 task specified, and this causes an error. For instance, the system can add a freight                 transaction for an AR invoice.  You have to provide mapping for the accounts that may be automatically added to                 project in the  Default Task for GL Account  table on the                      GL Accounts  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects                 (PM301000) form. If the same mapping should be used for multiple similar                 projects, specify the rules by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates                 (PM208000) form. Attributes for Account Groups You can create attributes to store additional properties of account groups that can                 be used in billing and in allocations. You can create attributes by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes (CS205000) form, and by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM202000|PM202000]) Attributes (PM202000) form, you can specify which of the                 attributes can be assigned to account groups. To assign attributes to a specific                 account group, use the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM201000|PM201000]) Account Groups (PM201000) form.

In Acumatica ERP, you can create project templates from scratch by adding every detail that you think will be required for a typical project of specific type. Alternatively, you can create a template based on an existing project which you think is a typical representative of projects of specific type. {br}

When users create projects based on the templates, they can change any settings for particular projects—templates are used only to provide the default settings, thus making the project creation easier for users. {br}{TOC}
==Templates Created from Existing Projects==
You can create a template based on an existing project. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, select a project that is a typical project of specific type and click '''Create Template''' from the '''Actions''' menu. A template will be created with all the tasks that were included in the project. You can modify the created template as you want. You can delete some of the tasks and add new tasks.
==Templates from Scratch==
You can create project templates from scratch by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. {br}

When you create a project template, you can specify as many settings as you want, including the following:[anchor|#ul_h3w_blj_jn]
*'''General information''': The broad information about the projects, including the default account and subaccount, default accrual account and subaccounts, and billing period. In the '''Status''' box, you can specify whether the specific project template is available for creating new projects. You can create projects only by using project templates with the ''Active'' status. 
*'''Visibility settings''': The list of the modules where the projects based on this template will be visible.
*'''Template tasks''': The tasks to be included in the projects based on this template. Tasks for the project template can be added by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_10|Project Template Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) form.
*'''List of employees''': The employees who will work on the projects and the project manager who will be monitoring projects of the type. You also specify labor items and hourly rates for employees working on this project. Also, you can specify whether only the listed employees can work for the project.
*'''List of equipment''': The equipment to be used for the projects with appropriate non-stock items designating setup, run, and suspend rates and respective hourly rates (prices) specific for projects of the type. You can specify whether only the listed equipment can be used for these projects.

==Template Tasks and Common Tasks==
A project template may include tasks that are actually templates of tasks that can be included in projects based on the template. You can add task templates to the project template. {br}

 You add the tasks to the project template and specify the settings for these tasks by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_10|Project Template Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208010|PM208010]) form. When you create a new template task, you can specify whether it is automatically included in all projects based on the project template. {br}

Template task settings include the following: [anchor|#ul_a5v_54s_mn]
*'''General settings''' are overall information about the task, including approver, tax category, default subaccount, and billing period. The general settings also include ''Visibility Settings'', the list of the modules in which this project task must be visible. You can make tasks visible only in the modules in which the parent project is visible—the scope for the task cannot be wider than the scope for the project.
*'''Recurring billing''' can be used to implement the flat-price scenario with recurring payments when your future project uses flat rates for services or products you provide to your customer regularly. For more information about recurring billing, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Billing_Procedure|Project Billing].

When a user creates a new project based on a project template, the user can add to the new project any of the tasks associated with this project template and any of the existing common tasks. {br}

Common tasks are also templates of tasks, but they are not linked to any specific project template and, as such, can be added to any new or existing project. You can create common tasks with the help of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_30|Common Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) form. Generally, you provide the same types of settings for common tasks as for the template tasks: general, budget, and recurring billing settings.

Many organizations use projects to achieve their business objectives efficiently. An organization may have multiple projects in progress. By limiting users&rsquo; access to and visibility of information about particular projects and related transactions, managers can properly organize the work on each project. In Acumatica ERP, you can use roles to provide access to forms according to employees&rsquo; responsibilities and restriction groups to configure the visibility of particular projects only to a responsible team, as described in this topic.[anchor|#_15c1c8a6-d4f9-490b-ae45-017971bd9c07]((({S:Hint}In Acumatica ERP, you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on the types of restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Types_of_Restriction_Groups|Types of Restriction Groups].
))){br}{TOC}
==Usage Scenarios==
The most common scenarios of managing the security of projects are the following:[anchor|#_cdcf9350-da12-4d15-b4a1-8270d810a5ee]
*Managing access to forms based on functional role: Each employee involved with a project has his or her specific tasks. You can configure user roles that will provide employees access to forms of the Projects module according to their responsibilities. For details, see [[#_ae962bbd-1eca-496f-8600-9bc690ebbfa4|Access to Forms Based on Roles].
*Managing the visibility of particular projects by user: If your organization has multiple project teams and multiple employees have the same functional responsibilities in different projects, you can make particular projects available to employees of only a particular project team by using restriction groups. For more information, see [[#_81274f93-1d3b-4cb5-a68b-777d6ce91353|Visibility of Projects by Users].
*Managing the visibility of projects by module: If a project should be associated with transactions in a particular module (such as Accounts Payable), you can make it visible only within this module. For details, see [[#_6206f015-c917-47f4-8a1f-76fc3933d0cd|Visibility of Projects by Modules].
[anchor|#_ae962bbd-1eca-496f-8600-9bc690ebbfa4]
==Access to Forms Based on Roles==
By using the forms of the User Security module, you can configure access rights to the forms of the Projects module for each employee in accordance with the employee&rsquo;s typical responsibilities. For more information about user roles, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Role-Based_Access|Role-Based Access].{br}

For example, you can create the following roles for employees of your organization who work with projects: [anchor|#_11237d08-bdb4-4837-a420-a1cd529bdc29]
*''Project Manager:'' A role for an employee who coordinates the project and is responsible for achieving the project goals. In the system, this person sets up pricing in projects, creates tasks, and configures projects and project templates. This role should have access to forms on the '''Configuration''' tab in the Projects module. Also, this role may have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form so that the users with this role can approve projects.
*''Project Controller'': A role for an employee who controls project transactions, performs allocations, and runs project billing. This role should have full access to forms on the '''Processes''' tab of the Projects module.
*''Project Accountant'': A role for an employee who plans and executes the project budget and enters project transactions. This role should have access to forms on the '''Work Area''' tab of the Projects module.
*''Project Team Member:'' A role for an employee who works for a project and enters time sheets and time cards. This role should have access to the forms on the '''Work Area''' tab of the Projects module and to the forms on the '''Work Area''' tab of the Time and Expenses module.
[anchor|#_81274f93-1d3b-4cb5-a68b-777d6ce91353]
==Visibility of Projects by Users==
By using the forms of the Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system to hide or display particular projects for employees, in addition to implementing task-based roles. Employees who have access to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form will be able to view or edit all the projects available in your organization. You may need to use restriction groups to restrict the visibility of specific projects to only employees of the project team. For details on restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\SM__con_Overview_of_Restriction_Groups|Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP].{br}

For example, suppose that you need to restrict the visibility of projects to employees in your organization considering the following: [anchor|#_91a36f1e-fcac-4fb5-b5a6-4db88fab1512]
*There are two projects in your organization: ''Project Y'' and ''Project Z''.
*User PM is a project manager who controls all projects in your organization.
*User AC is an accountant who plans budgets and performs transactions for all projects in your organization.
*Users E1 and E2 are engineers who work on ''Project Y''.
*Users E3 and E4 are engineers who work on ''Project Z''.

To configure the visibility of projects according to the listed statements, you would do the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_20_00|Project Access] ([~/?ScreenId=PM102000|PM102000]) form:[anchor|#_f2d1c7d8-4de7-4225-84e0-e5f4750e9302]
#You create two restriction groups of type ''A'' (with direct restriction): Group 1 for ''Project Y'' and Group 2 for ''Project Z''.
#In Group 1, you include ''Project Y'', User PM, User AC, Users E1 and E2.
#In Group 2, you include ''Project Z'', User PM, User AC, Users E3 and E4.

With the settings you have made, the visibility of projects would be the following:[anchor|#_5c340fbc-3e8d-4f99-a936-6a915ed96e8c]
*Users PM and AC can see both ''Project Y'' and ''Project Z''.
*Users E1 and E2 can see only ''Project Y''.
*Users E3 and E4 can see only ''Project Z''.
[anchor|#_6206f015-c917-47f4-8a1f-76fc3933d0cd]
==Visibility of Projects by Modules==
After you have created a project in Acumatica ERP, the project is available system-wide by default. You can control the visibility of projects within modules in the following ways:[anchor|#_72a452e8-1d9b-4c9c-89f0-e204f9cdc55a]
*Display or hide the '''Project''' boxes and columns on forms: If you use projects in a particular module (for example, Accounts Receivable), you can configure the system to display the boxes and columns where a user can select a project on forms only within this module. In the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, you can select all such modules.
*Display or hide a project: If the project transactions should be performed within a particular module (for example, Inventory), you can make the project visible only in this module so that users can select only appropriate projects when they are preparing documents. You can select modules in the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. After you have selected a module, users can select the project in documents generated on the module forms, and the release of these documents automatically updates the project data.
*Display or hide tasks of a project: If employees need to process documents related to a project in multiple modules, but the users perform particular tasks of a project in a certain module (for example, the ''Warehouse operations'' task is performed in the Inventory module and the ''Customer payments'' task is performed in the Accounts Receivable module), you can select the modules where the task will be displayed. You select these modules in the '''Visibility Settings''' section of the '''General Info''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Project Security Many organizations use projects to achieve their business objectives efficiently.                     An organization may have multiple projects in progress. By limiting users'                     access to and visibility of information about particular projects and related                     transactions, managers can properly organize the work on each project. In  Acumatica ERP, you can use roles to provide access to forms according to employees'                     responsibilities and restriction groups to configure the visibility of                     particular projects only to a responsible team, as described in this topic. In  Acumatica ERP,             you can configure groups with direct and inverse restriction. In this topic, for             simplicity, groups with direct restriction are used in examples. You can use inverse             restriction groups in the same way as you use direct restriction groups. For details on             the types of restriction groups, see  Types of Restriction Groups. Usage Scenarios The most common scenarios of managing the security of projects are the                     following: Managing access to forms based on functional role: Each employee involved                         with a project has his or her specific tasks. You can configure user roles                         that will provide employees access to forms of the Projects module according                         to their responsibilities. For details, see  Access to Forms Based on Roles Access to Forms Based on Roles. Managing the visibility of particular projects by user: If your organization                         has multiple project teams and multiple employees have the same functional                         responsibilities in different projects, you can make particular projects                         available to employees of only a particular project team by using                         restriction groups. For more information, see  Visibility of Projects by Users Visibility of Projects by Users. Managing the visibility of projects by module: If a project should be                         associated with transactions in a particular module (such as Accounts                         Payable), you can make it visible only within this module. For details, see                              Visibility of Projects by Modules Visibility of Projects by Modules. Access to Forms Based on Roles By using the forms of the User Security module, you can configure access rights to the forms of the Projects module for each employee in accordance with the employee's typical responsibilities. For more information about user roles, see  Role-Based Access. For example, you can create the following roles for employees of your organization who work with projects:  Project Manager:  A role for an employee who coordinates the project and is responsible for achieving the project goals. In the system, this person sets up pricing in projects, creates tasks, and configures projects and project templates. This role should have access to forms on the  Configuration  tab in the Projects module. Also, this role may have access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) Approvals (EP503010) form so that the users with this role can approve projects. Project Controller : A role for an employee who controls project transactions, performs allocations, and runs project billing. This role should have full access to forms on the  Processes  tab of the Projects module. Project Accountant : A role for an employee who plans and executes the project budget and enters project transactions. This role should have access to forms on the  Work Area  tab of the Projects module. Project Team Member:  A role for an employee who works for a project and enters time sheets and time cards. This role should have access to the forms on the  Work Area  tab of the Projects module and to the forms on the  Work Area  tab of the Time and Expenses module. Visibility of Projects by Users By using the forms of the Row-Level Security module, you can configure the system to hide or display particular projects for employees, in addition to implementing task-based roles. Employees who have access to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form will be able to view or edit all the projects available in your organization. You may need to use restriction groups to restrict the visibility of specific projects to only employees of the project team. For details on restriction groups, see  Restriction Groups in Acumatica ERP. For example, suppose that you need to restrict the visibility of projects to employees in your organization considering the following:  There are two projects in your organization:  Project Y  and  Project Z . User PM is a project manager who controls all projects in your organization. User AC is an accountant who plans budgets and performs transactions for all projects in your organization. Users E1 and E2 are engineers who work on  Project Y . Users E3 and E4 are engineers who work on  Project Z . To configure the visibility of projects according to the listed statements, you would do the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM102000|PM102000]) Project Access (PM102000) form: You create two restriction groups of type  A  (with direct restriction): Group 1 for  Project Y  and Group 2 for  Project Z . In Group 1, you include  Project Y , User PM, User AC, Users E1 and E2. In Group 2, you include  Project Z , User PM, User AC, Users E3 and E4. With the settings you have made, the visibility of projects would be the following: Users PM and AC can see both  Project Y  and  Project Z . Users E1 and E2 can see only  Project Y . Users E3 and E4 can see only  Project Z . Visibility of Projects by Modules After you have created a project in  Acumatica ERP, the project is available system-wide by default. You can control the visibility of projects within modules in the following ways: Display or hide the  Project  boxes and columns on forms: If you use projects in a particular module (for example, Accounts Receivable), you can configure the system to display the boxes and columns where a user can select a project on forms only within this module. In the  Visibility Settings  section of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form, you can select all such modules. Display or hide a project: If the project transactions should be performed within a particular module (for example, Inventory), you can make the project visible only in this module so that users can select only appropriate projects when they are preparing documents. You can select modules in the  Visibility Settings  section of the  General Info  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. After you have selected a module, users can select the project in documents generated on the module forms, and the release of these documents automatically updates the project data. Display or hide tasks of a project: If employees need to process documents related to a project in multiple modules, but the users perform particular tasks of a project in a certain module (for example, the  Warehouse operations  task is performed in the Inventory module and the  Customer payments  task is performed in the Accounts Receivable module), you can select the modules where the task will be displayed.

Because pricing is so important in managing projects, you can use the functionality of the Projects module to properly balance project revenues and costs. To ensure that business outcomes are met and the project budget is used effectively, you must establish an adequate pricing model. {br}{TOC}
==Rate Table==
A ''rate table'' is a mechanism the system uses to determine a specific value, ''rate'', for a particular transaction to be processed with the help of allocation rules. The table includes rates for all combinations of factors that might affect the rate, such as particular tasks, account groups, equipment used, inventory items involved, employees participating, and dates. Also, you can define separate rate sets for specific steps in allocation rules where the rates will be used (by using different rate types for different steps). The rate—that is, the value returned by the rate table for each transaction—can be referred to in the formulas of the allocation rules as ''@Rate'' and can be used as a multiplier, addend, or constant. For instance, to implement a price model that estimates the project price as its total costs plus 10 percent, you can define a rate of 1.1 in the appropriate rate table and calculate the project price as the total cost multiplied by this rate (''@Rate''=1.1). Also, you can define a rate as the hourly rate of an employee to be applied for a specific task only.{br}

You can create one rate table to be used for all projects or multiple tables to be used for different projects. ((({S:Hint}If you want to define rates of different types—such as expressed as factors (1.2, 1.0, 0.2), defined as amounts ($1000), or defined as hourly rates ($100 per hour)—create a separate rate table for each type. 
)))
==Rate Table Configuration==You fully configure a rate table in four stages by using the following forms:[anchor|#ol_xdv_ctn_3n]
#[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_42_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM204200|PM204200]): To create a rate table. Initially, you just create an empty container for a new rate table; later, on another form, you will specify the rates and date ranges.
#[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_41_00|Rate Types] ([~/?ScreenId=PM204100|PM204100]): To create rate types; during this stage, too, you are actually creating empty containers for the rate types. Consider a ''rate type'' as a new dimension in the same table. Typically, different rates are used to allocate labor costs, revenues, and expenses. At this stage, you plan only how many and which rate types you will need; later, when you create allocation rules, you will assign different rate types to different steps of allocation rules, so that you can define step-specific rates. 
#[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_50_00|Rate Lookup Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]): To create ''sequences'', each of which is a set of factors. Any combination of the following factors can be specified for a sequence: ''Project'', ''Project task'', ''Account group'', ''Inventory item'', and ''Employee''. For instance, if you include ''Project'' in a sequence, you will be able to define a special rate for a particular project or group of projects in the rate table. If you have two or more projects (or groups of projects) with different rates, create the same number of sequences or consider using different rate codes with the same sequence. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Rate_Codes_and_Pricing_Rates|Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples].
#[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]): To actually specify the rates (with their date ranges) for each sequence—that is, for each combination of particular factors. You can define rate codes on the fly to define multiple rates for the same sequence.

==Rate Lookup Sequences==
For rate tables, sequences include multiple factors that may affect the rates. You define sequences by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_50_00|Rate Lookup Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) form as follows: [anchor|#ul_l1h_h3t_bm]
*A sequence defines which of the factors affect the rate: projects, project tasks, employees, account groups, or inventory items. If, for example, tasks are a factor, special rates can be applied to particular tasks, or to particular tasks of particular projects if particular employees work on the tasks.
*The numeric identifiers of the sequences are important because they define the order in which the system uses the sequences to find the rate. Starting with the first sequence (the one with the smallest number), the system matches the factors specified on the transactions to the factors defined by a current sequence, and if the factors match, assigns the rate to the ''@Rate'' parameter. If the factors do not match, the system applies the next sequence (by its number). If the system doesn&rsquo;t find matching factors for the last sequence, it will operate according to the option selected for the particular step of the allocation rules. (You can select from the following options: ''Set @Rate to 1'', ''Set @Rate to 0'', ''Raise Error'', and ''Do not allocate''.)

A rate table may include different sets of sequences for different rate types. 
==Rate Codes==
A ''rate code'' is an additional dimension in a rate table that you can use to more easily configure a rate table. By using rate codes, you can reduce for each rate table-rate type pair the number of sequences you would otherwise create to specify all the required different rates. {br}

For example, suppose that you want to define a specific rate for each employee working on a project. You have two possible ways to create such rates:[anchor|#ol_tv5_gr3_hm]
*Create as many sequences with the '''Employee''' check box selected as there are employees to have a separate rate. In the rate table, enter one rate code for all these sequences. For each sequence, select a particular employee and enter the rate.
*Create only one sequence with the '''Employee''' check box selected. In the rate table, for each employee with a specific rate, enter a separate rate code, select the employee, and enter the rate for this employee.

The total number of code-sequence combinations are the same with both ways; however, with the second way (by using rate codes), you can reuse the same sequence to define multiple rates. Notice that even with different rate codes, combinations of particular factors should be unique within a sequence. When searching for rates, the system looks through all rate codes. 
==Rate Specification==
By using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form, you can finally fill in the rate table for each rate type that you are going to use in the allocation rules. Enter rates with the date range during which the rates are effective and, on tabs for different types of factors (that appear if they were defined in the rate lookup rules), specify particular factors, such as projects, tasks, employees, items, or account groups. ((({S:Hint}The rate application condition is defined as follows: Conditions on particular projects, items, employees, or account groups are joined by OR operators, while conditions on different rate factors are joined by AND operators. For instance, a special rate is valid for tasks 1, 2, 3 of Project 1 and Project 2 if employees JOHN or JACK are involved. The resulting condition is expressed as follows.
{{{{ ((Project=Project1) OR (Project=Project2))AND  
((Employee=JOHN) OR (Employee=JACK))AND
((Task=Task1) OR (Task=Task2)OR(Task=Task3))
 
}}}}
)))((({S:Warn}
You can use the ''@Rate'' value as a multiplier, an addend, or a constant. However, be consistent when you specify rates for different sequences for the same rate type— the meaning of all the rates should be the same, because all values are used in the same way in the same formula in allocation rules. 
)))
==Example of Rate Table Definition (One Rate Code)==
In this example, we will define the rates to be used to allocate labor costs in various projects. We will define sequences and rates for the rate type ''LABORRATE'', which is intended for labor cost allocations. {br}

Suppose that company employees Tom and John install home ventilation systems in a new house that was built by a construction company. The default hourly rate for Tom, a senior specialist, is $45 per hour, while for John, a junior specialist, the rate is $30. {br}

For the ''New House'' project (which is currently a standard project for the company), the rates of both employees do not change. In allocations, we will use the multiplier 1.0. The rate sequence is defined as follows.[anchor|#table_mkm_jfv_gm]
{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="12%" !  Sequence

{| class="checklist" | width="100%" 
|- 
!width="25%" !  Sequence
!width="25%" ! Employees
!width="25%" ! Start Date
!width="25%" ! @Rate
|- 
|  999
| Tom, John
|  1 Feb 2013
|  1.00
|}
With this sequence defined, the system will use @Rate=1.0 on allocation of all labor transactions on and after February 1, 2013. In allocation rules, we will use the rate (''@Rate'') as a multiplier for employees&rsquo; default hourly rates.
==Project-Specific Rates==
Imagine that the company discussed in the previous section takes on a new project, installing a ventilation system in a new office building. The project should be completed in a month, although it is the coldest time of the year and the building has no heating system. To take into account these uncomfortable working conditions, the project manager will increase employee rates by 50%. The rate sequences will be defined as follows.[anchor|#table_t3w_5gv_gm]

Imagine that the company later gets a contract for installing the ventilation system for an old brick house. For this project, employee experience and skills are important.

Thus, the system will apply a rate of 2.0 to transactions based on Tom&rsquo;s time card if they are related to the Old House project or a rate of 1.5 if they are related to the Office Building project, while the system will apply a rate of 1.0 to John&rsquo;s transactions unless they are related to the Office Building project (with rate of 1.5 for John).{br}

According to sequence 200 in the rate table, on the Old House project, the system will use a rate of 2.0 for Tom. On this project, according to sequence 999, the system will use a rate of 1.0 for John. ((({S:Hint}Notice that the reference number of sequences is important, because sequences are applied in the order of their numbers, from low to high. Sequence 999 does not check for projects, and if it exchanges numbers with the sequence 500, on the Office Building project, the system would use a rate of 1.0 for both Tom and John, because the system would stop on the sequence 500 and would not check the sequence 999. 
)))
==Example of Rate Table Definition (Multiple Rate Codes)==
In this example, we will define rates to be used in various projects and demonstrate how to use rate codes. We will define sequences and rates for the rate type ''LABORRATE'', which is intended for labor cost allocations. {br}

Suppose that company employees Tom and John again install home ventilation systems in new and old houses and in office buildings. These employees have different rates on all projects. There are three projects: one for a new house, one for an old house, and one for an office building. We need to create six sequences (specified in the following table) because for each project, we need to specify two different rates: one for Tom and another for John. [anchor|#table_ycx_2kk_hm]

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples Because pricing is so important in managing projects, you can use the functionality 				of the Projects module to properly balance project revenues and costs. To ensure 				that business outcomes are met and the project budget is used effectively, you must 				establish an adequate pricing model.  Rate Table A  rate table  is a mechanism the system uses to determine a specific value, 					 rate , for a particular transaction to be processed with the help of 				allocation rules. The table includes rates for all combinations of factors that 				might affect the rate, such as particular tasks, account groups, equipment used, 				inventory items involved, employees participating, and dates. Also, you can define 				separate rate sets for specific steps in allocation rules where the rates will be 				used (by using different rate types for different steps). The rate—that is, 				the value returned by the rate table for each transaction—can be referred to 				in the formulas of the allocation rules as  @Rate  and can be used as a 				multiplier, addend, or constant. For instance, to implement a price model that 				estimates the project price as its total costs plus 10 percent, you can define a 				rate of 1.1 in the appropriate rate table and calculate the project price as the 				total cost multiplied by this rate ( @Rate =1.1). Also, you can define a 				rate as the hourly rate of an employee to be applied for a specific task only. You can create one rate table to be used for all projects or multiple tables to be 				used for different projects.  If you want to define rates of different types—such as expressed as factors (1.2, 				1.0, 0.2), defined as amounts ($1000), or defined as hourly rates ($100 per 				hour)—create a separate rate table for each type.  Rate Table Configuration You fully configure a rate table in four 			stages by using the following forms:  ([~/?ScreenId=PM204200|PM204200]) Rate Tables (PM204200): To create a rate table. 					Initially, you just create an empty container for a new rate table; later, on 					another form, you will specify the rates and date ranges.  ([~/?ScreenId=PM204100|PM204100]) Rate Types (PM204100): To create rate types; during this 					stage, too, you are actually creating empty containers for the rate types. 					Consider a  rate type  as a new dimension in the same table. Typically, 					different rates are used to allocate labor costs, revenues, and expenses. At 					this stage, you plan only how many and which rate types you will need; later, 					when you create allocation rules, you will assign different rate types to 					different steps of allocation rules, so that you can define step-specific rates.   ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) Rate Lookup Rules (PM205000): To create  sequences , each 					of which is a set of factors. Any combination of the following factors can be 					specified for a sequence:  Project ,  Project task ,  Account 						group ,  Inventory item , and  Employee . For instance, if you 					include  Project  in a sequence, you will be able to define a special rate 					for a particular project or group of projects in the rate table. If you have two 					or more projects (or groups of projects) with different rates, create the same 					number of sequences or consider using different rate codes with the same 					sequence. For details, see  Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples.  ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables (PM206000): To actually specify the rates 					(with their date ranges) for each sequence—that is, for each combination 					of particular factors. You can define rate codes on the fly to define multiple 					rates for the same sequence. Rate Lookup Sequences For rate tables, sequences include multiple factors that may affect the rates. You 				define sequences by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) Rate Lookup Rules 				(PM205000) form as follows:  A sequence defines which of the factors affect the rate: projects, project tasks, employees, 					account groups, or inventory items. If, for example, tasks are a factor, special 					rates can be applied to particular tasks, or to particular tasks of particular 					projects if particular employees work on the tasks. The numeric identifiers of the sequences are important because they define the 					order in which the system uses the sequences to find the rate. Starting with the 					first sequence (the one with the smallest number), the system matches the 					factors specified on the transactions to the factors defined by a current 					sequence, and if the factors match, assigns the rate to the  @Rate  					parameter. If the factors do not match, the system applies the next sequence (by 					its number). If the system doesn't find matching factors for the last sequence, 					it will operate according to the option selected for the particular step of the 					allocation rules. (You can select from the following options:  Set @Rate to 						1 ,  Set @Rate to 0 ,  Raise Error , and  Do not 					allocate .) A rate table may include different sets of sequences for different rate types.  Rate Codes A  rate code  is an additional dimension in a rate table that you can use to more easily 				configure a rate table. By using rate codes, you can reduce for each rate table-rate 				type pair the number of sequences you would otherwise create to specify all the 				required different rates.  For example, suppose that you want to define a specific rate for each employee working on a 				project. You have two possible ways to create such rates: Create as many sequences with the  Employee  check box 					selected as there are employees to have a separate rate. In the rate table, 					enter one rate code for all these sequences. For each sequence, select a 					particular employee and enter the rate. Create only one sequence with the  Employee  check box 					selected. In the rate table, for each employee with a specific rate, enter a 					separate rate code, select the employee, and enter the rate for this 					employee. The total number of code-sequence combinations are the same with both ways; however, 				with the second way (by using rate codes), you can reuse the same sequence to define 				multiple rates. Notice that even with different rate codes, combinations of 				particular factors should be unique within a sequence. When searching for rates, the 				system looks through all rate codes.  Rate Specification By using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables (PM206000) form, you can finally fill in 				the rate table for each rate type that you are going to use in the allocation rules. 				Enter rates with the date range during which the rates are effective and, on tabs 				for different types of factors (that appear if they were defined in the rate lookup 				rules), specify particular factors, such as projects, tasks, employees, items, or 				account groups.  The rate application condition is defined as follows: Conditions on particular 				projects, items, employees, or account groups are joined by OR operators, while 				conditions on different rate factors are joined by AND operators. For instance, a 				special rate is valid for tasks 1, 2, 3 of Project 1 and Project 2 if employees JOHN 				or JACK are involved. The resulting condition is expressed as follows.  ((Project=Project1) OR (Project=Project2))AND  
((Employee=JOHN) OR (Employee=JACK))AND
((Task=Task1) OR (Task=Task2)OR(Task=Task3))
  You can use the  @Rate  value as a multiplier, an addend, or a constant. 					However, be consistent when you specify rates for different sequences for the 					same rate type— the meaning of all the rates should be the same, because 					all values are used in the same way in the same formula in allocation rules. 				 Example of Rate Table Definition (One Rate Code) In this example, 				we will define the rates to be used to allocate labor costs in various projects. We 				will define sequences and rates for the rate type  LABORRATE , which is 				intended for labor cost allocations.  Suppose that company employees Tom and 				John install home ventilation systems in a new house that was built by a 				construction company. The default hourly rate for Tom, a senior specialist, is $45 				per hour, while for John, a junior specialist, the rate is $30.  For the 					 New House  project (which is currently a standard project for the 				company), the rates of both employees do not change. In allocations, we will use the 				multiplier 1.0. The rate sequence is defined as follows.  Sequence Account Group Project Task Inventory Employee Description  999 False False False False True Default Rates (New House) The rate table will include one row, as follows.  Sequence Employees Start Date @Rate  999 Tom, John  1 Feb 2013  1.00 With this sequence defined, the system will use @Rate=1.0  on allocation of 				all labor transactions on and after  February 1, 2013. In allocation rules, we will 				use the rate ( @Rate ) as a multiplier for employees' default hourly 				rates. Project-Specific Rates Imagine that the company discussed in the 				previous section takes on a new project, installing a ventilation system in a new 				office building. The project should be completed in a month, although it is the 				coldest time of the year and the building has no heating system. To take into 				account these uncomfortable working conditions, the project manager will increase 				employee rates by 50%. The rate sequences will be defined as follows.  Sequence Account Group Project Task Inventory Employee Description  500 False True False False True Office Building  999 False False False False True Default Rates (New House) The rate table is as follows.  Sequence Project Employees Start Date Rate 500 Office Building Tom, John  1 Nov 2013   1.5 999 New House Tom, John 1 Feb 2013  1.0 Imagine that the company later gets a contract for installing the ventilation 				system for an old brick house. For this project, employee experience and skills are 				important. Tom, as a more experienced worker, will have twice his usual rate. The 				following sequence should be added.  Sequence Account Group Project Task Inventory Employee Description  200 False True False False True Old House 500 False True False False True Office Building  999 False False False False True Default Rates (New House)  Sequence Project Employee Start Date @Rate 200 Old House Tom 13 Nov 2013  2.0 500 Office Building Tom, John  1 Nov 2013  1.5 999 Default Rates (New House) Tom, John 1 Feb 2013  1.0 Thus, the system will apply a rate of 2.0 to transactions based on Tom's time 				card if they are related to the Old House project or a rate of 1.5 if they are 				related to the Office Building project, while the system will apply a rate of 1.0 to 				John's transactions unless they are related to the Office Building project (with 				rate of 1.5 for John). According to sequence 200 in the rate table, on the Old 				House project, the system will use a rate of 2.0 for Tom. On this project, according 				to sequence 999, the system will use a rate of 1.0 for John.  Notice that 				the reference number of sequences is important, because sequences are applied in the 				order of their numbers, from low to high. Sequence 999 does not check for projects, 				and if it exchanges numbers with the sequence 500, on the Office Building project, 				the system would use a rate of 1.0 for both Tom and John, because the system would 				stop on the sequence 500 and would not check the sequence 999.  Example of Rate Table Definition (Multiple Rate Codes) In this example, 				we will define rates to be used in various projects and demonstrate how to use rate 				codes. We will define sequences and rates for the rate type  LABORRATE , which 				is intended for labor cost allocations.  Suppose that company employees Tom 				and John again install home ventilation systems in new and old houses and in office 				buildings. These employees have different rates on all projects. There are three 				projects: one for a new house, one for an old house, and one for an office building. 				We need to create six sequences (specified in the following table) because for each 				project, we need to specify two different rates: one for Tom and another for John.

In Acumatica ERP, you can define sales prices for goods or services. You can express prices in a specific currency and define them for either particular customers or customers of specific customer price classes.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can maintain multiple prices by using the following mechanisms:[anchor|#ul_cb4_4nc_fp]
*''Default prices'': You can define a price for each inventory item in the '''Default Price''' box on the '''Price/Cost Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) form or on the '''Price/Cost Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form. Default prices, which you can specify manually or by using import scenarios, are expressed only in the base currency.
*''Price lists'': On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form, you can define a base price list, price lists that apply to a group of customers (customer price class) or a particular customer, promotional price lists, and prices that depend on the quantity of the product. If the ''Multi-Currency Accounting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, you can select the needed currency for a particular price list.

For more information about sales prices and their configuration, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__MNG_Sales_Prices|Managing Sales Prices].{br}{TOC}
==Sales Prices in Projects==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) forms, for Projects transactions with associated stock or non-stock items, you can retrieve the effective sales price of an inventory item by using the ''@Price'' parameter. For instance, to implement a price model that estimates the project billable amount as the billable quantity of the provided services multiplied by the price, you can use the following formula: <tt>=&#91;PMTran.BillableQty&#93;&#42;@Price</tt>.
==Sales Prices Selection==
The system selects the price for a particular inventory item by using the following priority:[anchor|#ul_kyg_byt_ndb]
#A sales price that is specific to the customer and defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form
#:((({S:Hint}For the first three prices in the search priority, a promotional sales price for which the '''Promotion''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] form prevails over a sales price with the same settings for which the check box is cleared.
)))
#A sales price that is specific to the customer price class and defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] form if there is no price specific to the customer
#The basic sales price that is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] form if there is no price specific to the customer price class
#The default price that is defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_20_00|Non-Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) or [HelpRoot_FormReference\IN_20_25_00|Stock Items] ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) form if there is no basic sales price

If the ''Multi-Currency Accounting'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form, for the billing process, the system selects the price for an inventory item in the currency that depends on the following settings and logic:[anchor|#ul_tgf_pxt_ndb]
*If the currency of the document is the base currency, the system selects the price of the item in the base currency using the priority listed above.
*If the '''Always Calculate Price from Base Currency Price''' check box is cleared on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form, the system selects the sales price of the item in the document currency.
*:If there is no sales price of the item in the document currency, the system recalculates the default price of the item, which is in the base currency, to the document currency.
*If the '''Always Calculate Price from Base Currency Price''' check box is selected on the '''Price/Discount Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] form, the system selects the sales price of the item in the base currency and recalculates this price to the document currency.
*:If there is no sales price of the item in the base currency, the system recalculates the default price of the item, which is in the base currency, to the document currency.

For the allocation process, the system always selects sales prices in the base currency.

In  Acumatica ERP, you can maintain multiple prices by using the following mechanisms: Default prices : You can define a price for each inventory item in the 						 Default Price  box on the  Price/Cost 						Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) form or on the  Price/Cost 						Info  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items 					(IN202500) form. Default prices, which you can specify manually or by using 					import scenarios, are expressed only in the base currency. Price lists : On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form, you can 					define a base price list, price lists that apply to a group of customers 					(customer price class) or a particular customer, promotional price lists, and 					prices that depend on the quantity of the product. If the  Multi-Currency 						Accounting  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features 					(CS100000) form, you can select the needed currency for a particular price 					list. For more information about sales prices and their configuration, see  Managing Sales Prices. Sales Prices in Projects On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules (PM207500) and   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules 				(PM207000) forms, for Projects transactions with associated stock or non-stock 				items, you can retrieve the effective sales price of an inventory item by using the 					 @Price  parameter. For instance, to implement a price model that 				estimates the project billable amount as the billable quantity of the provided 				services multiplied by the price, you can use the following formula: 					 =[PMTran.BillableQty]*@Price . Sales Prices Selection The system selects the price for a particular inventory item by using the following 				priority: A sales price that is specific to the customer and defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form For the first three prices 						in the search priority, a promotional sales price for which the 							 Promotion  check box is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices form prevails over a sales price with the same 						settings for which the check box is cleared. A sales price that is specific to the customer price class and defined on the 						  ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices form if there is no price specific to the 					customer The basic sales price that is defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices 					form if there is no price specific to the customer price class The default price that is defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202000|IN202000]) Non-Stock Items (IN202000) or   ([~/?ScreenId=IN202500|IN202500]) Stock Items (IN202500) form if there is no basic sales price If the  Multi-Currency Accounting  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form, for the billing process, the 				system selects the price for an inventory item in the currency that depends on the 				following settings and logic: If the currency of the document is the base currency, the system selects the 					price of the item in the base currency using the priority listed above. If the  Always Calculate Price from Base Currency Price  					check box is cleared on the  Price/Discount Settings  tab 					of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form, the system selects 					the sales price of the item in the document currency. If there is no sales 						price of the item in the document currency, the system recalculates the 						default price of the item, which is in the base currency, to the document 						currency. If the  Always Calculate Price from Base Currency Price  					check box is selected on the  Price/Discount Settings  tab 					of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences form, the system selects the sales price 					of the item in the base currency and recalculates this price to the document 						currency. If there is no sales price of the item in the base currency, the 						system recalculates the default price of the item, which is in the base 						currency, to the document currency. For the allocation process, the system always selects sales prices in the base 				currency.  ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000])  ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) ]]></column>

In Acumatica ERP 2019 R1, you can define labor cost rates specific to different entities, including the employee, labor item, project, project task, and rate type. The labor cost rates feature provides the following advantages:[anchor|#_102697f3-ea08-44ba-89d9-011cf70123c8]
*Visibility and maintenance of all the labor cost rates on a single form.
*Simple time entry because the system retrieves the labor items and labor cost rates.
*Ability to select a labor item in a time card line.
*Support of the prevailing wage.
*:The ''prevailing wage'' is a government mechanism to equalize the wage rates that are paid by a construction company to non-union workers compared to labor union workers for the same type of work performed for a certified job. A ''certified job'' is a job performed for government, such as a construction project of a municipal building. For a certified job, the government requires the construction companies to pay a non-union employee no less than the dictated prevailing wage rate.
*Support of union locals.
*:If an employee is a member of a local branch of a union, then the union requires the company to pay the dictated union rate, which is usually higher than the prevailing wage rate.

==Creation of Labor Cost Rates==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, you can view and edit the existing labor cost rates. Labor costs can be specified at particular detail levels—that is, for particular entities or groups of entities. You can create labor cost rates of the following types and detail levels:[anchor|#_12cb5eb1-8dd1-4fd2-93eb-3934cb7e894c]
*''Labor Item'': The labor item
*''Employee'': The employee and optionally the labor item
*''Project'': The project and optionally any of the following: the project task, the employee, and the labor item
*''Union Wage'': The union local and labor item
*''Prevailing Wage'': The project and labor item
((({S:Hint}You can view, edit, and create labor cost rates of the ''Union Wage'' and ''Prevailing Wage'' types if the ''Construction'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
For each labor cost rate, you specify the effective date. If there are multiple labor cost rates with the same settings, the system uses the rate with the actual effective date—that is, with the most recent effective date that precedes the current date. You can also create a labor cost rate with the same settings as an existing labor cost rate but with an effective date later than the latest effective date of the existing labor cost rate.{br}

When you specify the rate for a line with a selected labor item, you specify the rate for the base unit of measure (UOM) of the labor item.{br}

For example, suppose that you have the ''TRAINING'' labor item, whose base UOM is ''UNIT''. According to the conversion rules specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form, one unit equals four hours. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] form, when you add a labor cost rate with an employee and the ''TRAINING'' labor item, you should specify the hourly rate for the base UOM, which is ''UNIT'', even if the unit consists of four hours. When the employee enters a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form and select in a time activity the ''TRAINING'' labor item, the time is reported in hours even though the base UOM of the selected item is not an hour. When the time card with the corresponding time activities is released, the system generates a project transaction with the ''TRAINING'' labor item in the base UOM of the item. If the employee has reported eight hours, the transaction contains two ''TRAINING'' units.((({S:Hint}[anchor|#_3fbeae1d-51f4-44da-91d6-b8315b62a0a0]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_99_00|Labor Cost Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209900|PM209900]) form, when you create a labor cost rate with a labor item with a base UOM that is not an hour, make sure that you enter the hourly rate for the base UOM of the labor item so that the system calculates the correct amount when a time activity with this labor item is released.
*The base UOM of the labor item should be convertible into minutes so that the system can convert the base UOM to a minute and vice versa. That is, there should be the conversion rules from a minute to the base UOM on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_31_00|Units of Measure] ([~/?ScreenId=CS203100|CS203100]) form.
)))
==Retrieval of Labor Cost Rates==
When you create a time card on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]) form, for each line, you select the employee, project, project task, labor item, date, union local, certified job, and worker compensation code.((({S:Hint}The '''Certified Job''', '''Union Local''', and '''WCC Code''' columns are shown on the '''Summary''' and '''Details''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] form if the ''Construction'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
)))
The system automatically selects the '''Certified Job''' check box in the time card line if for the corresponding project, the '''Certified Job''' check box is selected in the '''Project Properties''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. You can clear this check box if it has been selected or select it manually, if needed.{br}

The system automatically populates the '''Union Local''' column in the time card line by using the settings of the employee and the project as follows:[anchor|#_2e5021b6-71de-4fba-84bb-887f12ec8d88]
*If the employee has a '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] ([~/?ScreenId=EP203000|EP203000]) form and the project has no union local specified on the '''Union Locals''' tab of the of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system inserts the union local of the employee into the column.
*If the employee has a '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form and this union local is one of the union locals of the project specified on the '''Union Locals''' tab of the of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system inserts the union local of the employee into the column.
*If the employee has a '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form and this union local is not one of the union locals of the project specified on the '''Union Locals''' tab of the of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system leaves the '''Union Local''' column blank.
*If the employee has no '''Union Local ID''' specified in the '''Employee Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_30_00|Employees] form, the system leaves the '''Union Local''' column blank.

In the time card, you can clear a '''Union Local''' value that has been selected or select a union local manually, if needed.{br}

For each time card line, the system retrieves the cost rate for the specified employee, project, project task, labor item, date, union local, and certified job as follows:[anchor|#_067e04ad-4815-4e87-bbe6-3f2b17399431]
#Among labor cost rates of the ''Project'', ''Employee'', and ''Labor Item'' rate types, the system selects the most specific existing labor cost rate that matches all the settings specified in the time card line. The following list shows the sets of settings of the labor cost rate, from the most specific to the least specific:
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, employee, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, employee, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, project task, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, employee, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, employee, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Project'' rate type, project, and effective date
#*The ''Employee'' rate type, employee, labor item, and effective date
#*The ''Employee'' rate type, employee, and effective date
#*The ''Labor Item'' rate type, labor item, and effective date
#For the time card line, if the '''Certified Job''' check box is selected and a '''Union Local''' is specified, the system selects the ''Union Wage'' and ''Prevailing Wage'' rate types that match the settings specified in the time card line. Then the system compares the most specific labor cost rate that has been found in the previous step with the selected labor cost rates of the ''Union Wage'' and ''Prevailing Wage'' rate types. Based on the comparison, the system selects the higher labor cost rate.

In Acumatica ERP, you can implement virtually any pricing model by using rate tables and rate types. For more information on the functionality, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Rate_Codes_and_Pricing_Rates|Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples]. You fully configure a rate table by completing each of the following stages. 
==To Create a New Rate Table==[anchor|#ol_n2v_ctn_3n]
#On the '''Organization''' tab, click '''Projects'''. In the left pane, navigate to '''Configuration''' > '''Setup''' > '''Rate Tables'''.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
#In the '''Rate Table''' column, type the identifier for the new rate table.
#In the '''Description''' column, provide a description for this new rate table.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.

==To Create Rate Types==[anchor|#ol_r2v_ctn_3n]
#On the '''Organization''' tab, click '''Projects'''. In the left pane, navigate to '''Configuration''' > '''Setup''' > '''Rate Types'''.
#On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
#In the '''Rate Type''' column, type the identifier for the new rate type. We recommend that you specify identifiers in accordance with the type of allocation to be performed with this rate type, such as ''LABOR'' for labor cost allocations and ''BURDEN'' for allocating costs.
#In the '''Description''' column, provide a description for this new rate table.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.

==To Create Sequences==[anchor|#ol_v2v_ctn_3n]
#On the '''Organization''' tab, click '''Projects'''. In the left pane, navigate to '''Configuration''' > '''Setup''' > '''Rate Lookup Rules'''.
#In the '''Rate Table''' box, select the rate table that you want to configure.
#In the '''Rate Type''' box, select one of the rate types to be used with this rate table.
#For each planned sequence, do the following:
##On the table toolbar, click '''Add Row'''.
##In the '''Sequence''' column, type the sequence reference number. You can enter only digits in this box.
##:((({S:Hint}Leave a gap between reference numbers if you want to be able to insert additional sequences if needed without renumbering the existing sequences.
)))
##In the '''Description''' column, provide a description for this new sequence.
##Select which types of factors affect the rate by selecting the check boxes in the respective columns: '''Project''', '''Project Task''', '''Account Group''', '''Inventory''', and '''Employee'''.
#Review the reference numbers of sequences and adjust them if needed, keeping in mind that the numbers define the order in which the system will be applying the sequences to find the rate.
#Click '''Save''' on the form toolbar.
#If you plan to use the rate table with more than one rate type (that is, in more than one allocation step), perform Steps 3 through 6 for each remaining rate type.

==To Enter Rates==[anchor|#ol_kfv_ctn_3n]
#On the '''Organization''' tab, click '''Projects'''. In the left pane, navigate to '''Work Area''' > '''Manage''' > '''Rate Tables'''.
#In the '''Rate Table''' box, select the rate table you are going to fill in.
#In the '''Rate Type''' box, select the rate type for which you are going to define rates in the selected rate table.
#In the '''Sequence''' box, select one of the sequences defined for this rate table and this rate type, which you created by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_50_00|Rate Lookup Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) form, as described in the previous section. For the factors selected for this sequence, the respective tabs appear.
#In the '''Rate Code''' box, type the new rate code.
#In the '''Description''' box, provide a description of the rate code to be used for a new set of factors.
#On the '''Rate''' tab, click '''Add Row'''.
#In the '''Start Date''' column, select the date when the rate will become (or has become) effective.
#In the '''End Date''' column, select the date that ends that date range when the rate is effective.
#In the '''Rate''' column, enter the rate.
#On each tab with a factor defined by this sequence, create the list of particular factors for which this rate is applicable as follows:

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[To Configure a Rate Table In  Acumatica ERP, you can implement virtually any pricing model by using rate tables and rate                 types. For more information on the functionality, see  Rate Tables: Usage and Configuration Examples. You fully configure a rate                 table by completing each of the following stages.  To Create a New Rate Table On the  Organization  tab, click                          Projects . In the left pane, navigate to  Configuration Setup Rate Tables . On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Rate Table  column, type the identifier for the new                     rate table. In the  Description  column, provide a description for this                     new rate table. Click  Save  on the form toolbar. To Create Rate Types On the  Organization  tab, click                          Projects . In the left pane, navigate to  Configuration Setup Rate Types . On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Rate Type  column, type the identifier for the new                     rate type. We recommend that you specify identifiers in accordance with the type                     of allocation to be performed with this rate type, such as  LABOR  for                     labor cost allocations and  BURDEN  for allocating costs. In the  Description  column, provide a description for this                     new rate table. Click  Save  on the form toolbar. To Create Sequences On the  Organization  tab, click                          Projects . In the left pane, navigate to  Configuration Setup Rate Lookup Rules . In the  Rate Table  box, select the rate table that you                     want to configure. In the  Rate Type  box, select one of the rate types to be                     used with this rate table. For each planned sequence, do the following: On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the  Sequence  column, type the sequence                             reference number. You can enter only digits in this box. Leave a                                 gap between reference numbers if you want to be able to insert                                 additional sequences if needed without renumbering the existing                                 sequences. In the  Description  column, provide a description                             for this new sequence. Select which types of factors affect the rate by selecting the check                             boxes in the respective columns:  Project ,                                  Project Task ,  Account                                 Group ,  Inventory , and                                  Employee . Review the reference numbers of sequences and adjust them if needed, keeping in                     mind that the numbers define the order in which the system will be applying the                     sequences to find the rate. Click  Save  on the form toolbar. If you plan to use the rate table with more than one rate type (that is, in more                     than one allocation step), perform Steps 3 through 6 for each remaining rate                     type. To Enter Rates On the  Organization  tab, click                          Projects . In the left pane, navigate to  Work Area Manage Rate Tables . In the  Rate Table  box, select the rate table you are                     going to fill in. In the  Rate Type  box, select the rate type for which you                     are going to define rates in the selected rate table. In the  Sequence  box, select one of the sequences defined                     for this rate table and this rate type, which you created by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM205000|PM205000]) Rate Lookup Rules (PM205000) form, as described in the previous                     section. For the factors selected for this sequence, the respective tabs                     appear. In the  Rate Code  box, type the new rate code. In the  Description  box, provide a description of the rate                     code to be used for a new set of factors. On the  Rate  tab, click  Add                     Row . In the  Start Date  column, select the date when the rate                     will become (or has become) effective. In the  End Date  column, select the date that ends that                     date range when the rate is effective. In the  Rate  column, enter the rate. On each tab with a factor defined by this sequence, create the list of                     particular factors for which this rate is applicable as follows: On the table toolbar, click  Add Row . In the first column, select the particular factor of the specified type.                             (For instance, select an employee if this is the                                  Employee  tab.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
In Acumatica ERP, ''allocation'' is the process of allocating amounts to specific accounts, account groups, or both to acknowledge expenses and revenues. For instance, each month you can allocate amounts of the actual expenditures entailed by the project and the future revenues calculated based on those expenditures. The allocation process is governed by allocation rules you specify by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) form. {br}

The allocation process consists of two basic stages: 
*'''Selection of transactions''': By using allocation rule settings, Acumatica ERP selects only those transactions that conform to the rule settings. These are used as underlying transactions for allocating amounts and quantities. For instance, you can use as an underlying transaction a bill your employee paid when providing service to a customer.
*'''Allocation''': Acumatica ERP generates one or more allocation transactions with the amounts and quantities calculated based on those of the underlying transactions. You can specify rules that generate any transactions involving any accounts and posting; however, you normally use allocation to account for your current reimbursable costs (based on the completion percents of project tasks) and future revenues from the project. For instance, if you use a cost-based pricing model that implies a 15 percent uptick, you can specify an allocation rule that adds up all the cost transactions&rsquo; current amounts, multiplies the sum by 1.15, and debits the resulting amount to the account you use for tracking your unbilled revenue. 
{br}{TOC}
==Tracking Current Revenue==
You may want to view future revenues as they are accumulated during project execution, regardless of when they will be actually recognized, charged to the customer, or both. For instance, the project may be billed monthly but you may need to track the amount you will bill to the customer weekly or even daily. This way, you can continuously monitor how the actual revenues align with the projected revenues for the project. {br}

In Acumatica ERP, you can track future project-related revenues as they are accumulated by allocating the corresponding amounts to special account groups. To track future revenues, you need to create the following account groups: 
*'''Unbilled Revenue:''' This is an account group of the ''Asset'' type used to accumulate future revenue. When you view the allocation rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, this account group appears in the '''Debit''' column. This way, each time you run allocation, you post to this account group the amounts that you plan to bill to the customer. This account group may include multiple accounts to enable allocating different amounts for different allocations—for instance, allocating amounts for travel, labor, and services. Alternatively, you can use different accounting groups for each of these categories.
*'''Unrecognized Revenue:''' This account group of the ''Liability'' type is used to accumulate unrecognized revenue. When you view the allocation rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_75_00|Allocation Rules] form, this account group appears in the '''Credit''' column. This way, each time you run allocation, you post the amounts that you plan to recognize as revenue to this account group. This account group may include multiple accounts to enable allocating different amounts for different allocations.

Each time you run allocation, you debit the account group used for unbilled revenue and credit the account group used for unrecognized revenue for the same amount. Later, you will recognize this amount as revenue and charge it to the customer when you run billing for the project. 
==Multiple Steps of the Allocation Rules==
 For allocation purposes, you normally use the cost transactions. In Acumatica ERP, this method is called ''Transaction'' and is defined in the allocation rule for the project. This method can be used in multiple steps of an allocation rule. With this method, the pricing for the project is based on direct costs associated with the project.{br}

Using multiple steps of the ''Transaction'' type, you can allocate future revenues for different activities. For example, the first step can allocate reimbursable travel expenses, while the second step can allocate labor time. 
==Formulas in Allocation Rules==
In formulas of an allocation rule, to retrieve the data, you can use the following data access classes:[anchor|#_08adbc35-6de2-425f-93d4-bd17b7f41183]
*{{PMAccountGroup}}
*{{PMBudget}}
*{{PMProject}}
*{{PMTask}}
*{{PMTran}}
*{{Customer}}
*{{EPEmployee}}
*{{InventoryItem}}
*{{Vendor}}

When you allocate a project using an allocation rule with a formula that uses the {{PMBudget}} data access class, for each budget line of the project, the system retrieves {{PMBudget}} records that are associated with the same project, project task, account group, inventory item, and cost code if the ''Cost Code'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.
==Allocating Labor in Projects==
If the Projects module is not enabled, the release of a transaction in the Time and Expenses module generates the corresponding transactions in the Accounts Payable module. Enabling the Projects module in Acumatica ERP changes the way transactions are released in the Time and Expenses module. {br}

When non-project transactions are released, Acumatica ERP generates regular Accounts Payable transactions. If you enable the Projects module functionality, the release of a transaction associated with a specific project does not generate an Accounts Payable transaction, but instead generates the corresponding Projects module transactions. The further processing of the Projects transactions originating in the Time and Expenses module is handled in the Projects module using allocation and billing rules. This workflow with the extra stage allows you to use costs in allocating and billing for projects and implement a cost-driven pricing model. Once you have all direct labor costs for the project entered in the Projects module, you can use the transaction information to allocate for the project any amounts and quantities enforced by your pricing model.

Unrecognized Revenue:  This account group of the  Liability  type is                     used to accumulate unrecognized revenue. When you view the allocation rule on                     the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207500|PM207500]) Allocation Rules form, this account group appears in the                          Credit  column.

If you need to bill customers for the services provided as a part of a project, you can generate invoices based on the information collected in the Projects module. The billing procedure is available only for external projects—that is, for projects associated with customers. You can run the billing procedure automatically, manually, or on a schedule. You can enable draft invoices for a particular project, which gives you the ability to review and modify billable transactions and amounts in a draft invoice before you prepare the final Accounts Receivable invoice with all information copied from the draft invoice. Also, you can choose whether to post any amounts to the General Ledger when you run the billing procedure.{br}{TOC}
==Billing Procedure==
In Acumatica ERP, you perform project billing by using one of the following forms:[anchor|#ul_tg4_54c_bcb]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can run billing for the selected project by clicking '''Run Project Billing''' on the form toolbar. If the project is pending billing, the system creates an invoice with a date that is the same as the '''Next Billing Date''' of the project. For projects with the ''On Demand'' billing period, the date of the invoice is the business date.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_30_00|Run Project Billing] ([~/?ScreenId=PM503000|PM503000]) form, you can run billing for multiple projects that are pending billing, depending on the '''Invoice Date''' selected in the Summary area of the form. (By default, this box contains the business date.) The system creates invoices with a date that is the same as the '''Invoice Date'''.
*:((({S:Hint}The form does not show the projects with the '''Next Billing Date''', which is specified on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, is later than the '''Invoice Date''', which in specified in the Selection area of the form.
)))

On both forms, the system bills only a project that is pending billing—that is, at least one of the following exist for the project:[anchor|#ul_e4h_2qc_bcb]
*An unbilled transaction that is ready to be billed on the invoice date—that is, the date of the transaction is not later than the invoice date.
*:The invoice date is the date of the invoice that the system creates during the billing. The invoice date depends on the form where you run billing as follows:
**On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the invoice date is the '''Next Billing Date''', which is specified on the '''Summary''' tab, for all the projects except those that are billed on demand.
**On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the invoice date is the business date for all the projects for which the '''Billing Period''', which is specified on the '''Summary''' tab, is ''On Demand''.
**On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_30_00|Run Project Billing] form, the invoice date is the '''Invoice Date''', which in specified in the Selection area of the form.
*:Whether the system uses or not the transactions with the date is equal to the invoice date depends on the '''Billing Cut-off Date''' setting on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form as follows:
**''Include Trans. created on billing date'': With this setting, the unbilled transaction is ready to be billed if its date is earlier than or the same as the invoice date.
**''Exclude Trans. created on billing date'': With this setting, the unbilled transaction is ready to be billed if its date is earlier than the invoice date.
*A revenue budget line with a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, including a negative amount.
*An amount postponed to the next billing from a pro forma invoice for which the corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice is released.
*A task with a recurring billing item.

The billing procedure in Acumatica ERP is straightforward and depends on the type of a step of the billing rule, which is specified for a project task on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, as follows:[anchor|#ul_dh1_tsk_2bb]
*For the ''Time and Material'' steps of the billing rules of project tasks, the system selects all the outstanding allocated project transactions and generates an invoice for the customer based on these transactions and according to the billing rule (for details about billing rules, see the section below).
*:If you do not want to bill any of the transactions, you can use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_50_00|Reverse Unbilled Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM505000|PM505000]) form to reverse allocated transactions (either all listed transactions at once or only the selected ones).
*For the ''Progress Billing'' steps of the billing rules of project tasks whose processing does not involve allocations, the system generates an invoice with the billable project revenue, meaning the revenue budget lines with a nonzero '''Pending Invoice Amount''' listed on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.

For the billing process for a project to be run successfully, the project should meet the following criteria:[anchor|#ul_hhc_2m1_hbb]
*All the mandatory settings should be specified for the project and its tasks.
*The project status should be ''Active'', ''Completed'', or ''Suspended''.
*The status of the project tasks should be ''Active'' or ''Completed'', and the billing rule should be specified for these tasks.
*The project should have a provision for billing, such as a billable line of the revenue budget associated with the task for a progress billing, or an unbilled project transaction associated with the task within this billing period for a time and material billing.
*The steps of the billing rule should be applicable to the billing provisions. For example, the billing rule of a task that is supposed to be billed by a revenue budget line should have a ''Progress Billing'' step.

==Billing Rules==
For each project task, the billing process is defined by billing rules, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. For each billing rule, you can create steps of the following types:[anchor|#ul_gdm_dcl_2bb]
*A single ''Progress Billing'' step to bill pending invoice amounts
*Multiple ''Time and Material'' steps to bill transactions by different account groups

In a single billing rule, you can mix these types of billing steps, as well as create separate billing rules for each type of step. Each step of a billing rule has a variety of settings that depend on the step type, including the following:[anchor|#ul_ccd_fzk_2bb]
*The account group that is used as a filter to select the transactions for billing by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps. The system selects all the transactions that are due for billing when the billing procedure is run. Normally, you use for billing the same account group or groups that you use for accumulating the unrecognized revenue. By running billing for these account groups, you recognize the revenue.
*Formulas to define the description of the invoice and each invoice line, to make the system compose these descriptions dynamically during the billing process.
*Formulas to calculate the amount and quantity of the invoice lines created by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps. In these formulas, you can use fields and attributes from such entities as the project, project budget, project task, project transaction, customer, vendor, employee, inventory item, and account group. You can also use different sources of the project rates: those from the rate tables that can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_60_00|Rate Tables] ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) form, and those from sales price lists that are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_20_20_00|Sales Prices] ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) form.
*The sources of the sales account and the destination branch for each invoice line.
*:The billing process uses the originating branch from the project settings on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and the destination branches from the sources according to the billing rules. When an Accounts Receivable invoice is released, the Accounts Receivable account is updated under the originating branch of the invoice, while the revenue amounts are recorded to the destination branches of the invoice lines.
*The invoice group to make the system create separate invoices for particular steps with the similar invoice group during the project billing (either pro forma invoices or Accounts Receivable invoices, depending on the billing workflow of the project).
*:During the billing process, the system groups the billable amounts into invoices by the following:[anchor|#ul_wn4_122_pbb]
**The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the project tasks refer
**The customer
**The customer location
**The '''Bill Separately''' setting of each project task defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form
*Non-billable transactions that do not contribute to the amount billed to the customer and that you may decide to include in the invoice.
*Grouping criteria by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item for the invoice lines created by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps.

==Formulas in Billing Rules==
In formulas of a billing rule, to retrieve the data, you can use the following data access classes:[anchor|#_08adbc35-6de2-425f-93d4-bd17b7f41183]
*{{PMAccountGroup}}
*{{PMBudget}}
*{{PMProject}}
*{{PMTask}}
*{{PMTran}}
*{{Customer}}
*{{EPEmployee}}
*{{InventoryItem}}
*{{Vendor}}

When you bill a project using a billing rule with a formula that uses the {{PMBudget}} data access class, for each budget line of the project, the system retrieves {{PMBudget}} records that are associated with the same project, project task, account group, inventory item, and cost code if the ''Cost Code'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.[anchor|#section_rxl_kjw_1bb]
==Progress Billing==
Progress billing is a simple billing workflow for the projects that are gradually billed at a fixed contract amount. Progress billing does not involve project transactions, and the system uses ''Progress Billing'' steps of billing rules of the project tasks to process this billing. The project setup and the billing workflow proceed as follows:[anchor|#ul_krj_rnp_1bb]
*A user adds a revenue budget line with a '''Revised Amount''' to a project on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
*To provide a billable amount (for example, on a monthly basis), the user populates the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' or '''Completed (%)''' column on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab for the revenue budget lines to make the system calculate the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' as follows:
*:{{Pending Invoice Amount = Revised Budgeted Amount * ( Completed (%) / 100 ) - Draft Invoices Amount - Actual Amount}}
*The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an Accounts Receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow).
*The system creates an invoice with the amounts derived from the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' column of the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form for the revenue budget lines. The system updates the '''Draft Invoices Amount''' of the revenue budget lines with the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' and clears the '''Pending Invoice Amount'''.
*If the system creates a pro forma invoice (depending on the selected workflow), the invoice lines that are produced by the progress billing steps are displayed on the '''Progress Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.
((({S:Hint}[anchor|#ul_syj_rnp_1bb]
*If a project task uses a billing rule that has no ''Progress Billing'' step, when the system updates the '''Completed (%)''' column on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system does not recalculate the '''Pending Invoice Amount''' column for the revenue budget lines that belong to this task, and the system ignores any pending invoice amount of these lines during the billing process.
*The '''Actual Quantity''' of the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) is always zero in the revenue budget lines that are billed only by progress billing.
)))[anchor|#section_hpm_c4w_1bb]
==Transaction-Based Billing==
This billing workflow is provided for projects that are billed based on project transactions. The system uses the ''Time and Material'' steps of the billing rules of the project tasks to process this billing. A billing rule may have a number of ''Time and Material'' steps for different account groups of transactions that should be used to determine the invoiced amounts by different formulas. The ''Time and Material'' billing can be executed right after the project transactions that match the selection criteria have been provisioned in the system. The allocation process can be executed before billing, if necessary.{br}

The project setup and billing workflow proceeds as follows:[anchor|#ul_sck_rnp_1bb]
*The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an Accounts Receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow).
*The system creates the invoice based on the unbilled project transactions with amounts calculated by the billing rules of the project tasks.
*:The system considers in the billing the transactions with a date that is earlier than the billing date and does not consider the transactions with the date that is later than the billing date. The transactions with a date on the billing date are billed if ''Include Trans. created on billing date'' is selected as the '''Billing Cut-off Date''' on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
*If the system creates a pro forma invoice, the invoice lines that are produced by the ''Time and Material'' billing steps are displayed on the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form.

==Recurring Billing==
Your company may provide services to customers regularly for a flat price. For instance, you can lease construction machines to customers for an agreed number of hours per month for a fixed price. If you decide to manage this activity as a project, you do not have to manually create a new invoice every month—each time you run project billing, recurring transactions are added to the invoice (or to the invoice listed first in the rule if multiple invoices must be generated for the billing rule). Recurring billing is a task-level setting you define on the '''Recurring Billing''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. You can use non-stock items as line items for recurring billing to track employee and equipment work time. For each item, you can specify the following: 
*The flat price charged once each billing period.
*The number of units included in the item fee. For instance, you may have an agreement with the customer to provide 40 hours of road scraper work at a flat price, while any extra hours are charged on a per-hour basis.
*The option that determines whether the number of units included in the flat price is to be reset for each billing period or it is a fixed number for the entire project duration. For instance, with the agreement for 40 hours of road scraper work at a flat monthly price, you can use hour as the unit of measure and reset the number of hours each month to ensure that the customer gets their quota of 40 hours each month. In a different scenario, the agreement may imply the lease of one to three road scrapers to the customer at a flat monthly price (here, you use scraper as a unit of measure); in this case, you do not need to reset the number of scrapers each month.
*The minimum number of units for which billing may be performed. If the amount of services or products you provide is less than this value, you do not charge the customer. For instance, your agreement may stipulate a flat monthly price for 10 to 40 hours of road scraper work. Any scraper time below 10 hours is not charged.

The billing period is a project-wide setting that you specify when planning the project at the level of the project template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. The following options are available: ''Week'', ''Month'', ''Quarter'', ''Year'', or ''On Demand''. The ''On Demand'' option defines the billing that may be initiated when it is needed.
==Billing of Postponed Amounts==
With the draft invoice workflow, a user can modify a pro forma invoice and postpone the difference until the next billing. This remaining amount will be billed during the next billing if the Accounts Receivable invoice that contains the line from which the remainder originates is released. For more information about the draft invoice workflow, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Draft_Invoice_Workflow|Pro Forma Invoices].
==Reversing an Accounts Receivable Invoice==
When you reverse a released Accounts Receivable invoice that was created based on a project transaction, the system creates the corresponding credit memo. When you release this reversing credit memo, the system creates the non-billable reversing project transaction that reverses the impact of the original project transaction. The original project transaction remains billed. The system also creates a copy of the original project transaction with the original amount even if this amount was adjusted in the credit memo. The date and the financial period of this copied project transaction are the same as the date and the financial period of the credit memo. The copied project transaction is unbilled. Thus, as the result of such a reversal, there are the following project transactions in the system:[anchor|#_1de2680c-fdd1-499e-9e77-1980e8981250]
*The original project transaction, which is billed
*The non-billable reversing project transaction, which reverses the impact of the original project transaction
*The copy of the original project transaction, which is unbilled

==Mapping of Accounts to Tasks==
When you run a billing procedure for a project, the system may generate additional transactions—for instance, to include a discount or freight charge. Such transactions are automatically associated with the project, but you may also need to automatically associate these transactions with specific tasks in the project.{br}

You can have Acumatica ERP automatically assign transactions to specific tasks by mapping specific General Ledger accounts to tasks within the project in the '''Default Task for GL Account''' section on the '''GL Accounts''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. Once you map a General Ledger account to a task, any transactions automatically generated by the system and associated with the account will be linked to this default task.
==Project Billing in Migration Mode==
If Accounts Receivable is in migration mode—that is, the '''Activate Migration Mode''' check box is selected in the '''Posting Settings''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_10_10_00|Accounts Receivable Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) form, the system does not create invoices during project billing. The creation of AR documents and pro forma invoices during project billing and the creation of AR documents during the release of pro forma invoices are not available.{br}

For more information on migration mode, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__con_Migration_Process_Overview|Migrating Documents to Acumatica ERP].

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Project Billing If you need to bill customers for the services provided as a part of a project, you 				can generate invoices based on the information collected in the Projects module. The 				billing procedure is available only for external projects—that is, for 				projects associated with customers. You can run the billing procedure automatically, 				manually, or on a schedule. You can enable draft invoices for a particular project, 				which gives you the ability to review and modify billable transactions and amounts 				in a draft invoice before you prepare the final Accounts Receivable invoice with all 				information copied from the draft invoice. Also, you can choose whether to post any 				amounts to the General Ledger when you run the billing procedure. Billing Procedure In  Acumatica ERP, you perform project billing by using one of the following forms: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, you can run billing for 					the selected project by clicking  Run Project Billing  on 					the form toolbar. If the project is pending billing, the system creates an 					invoice with a date that is the same as the  Next Billing 						Date  of the project. For projects with the  On Demand  					billing period, the date of the invoice is the business date. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM503000|PM503000]) Run Project Billing (PM503000) form, you can 					run billing for multiple projects that are pending billing, depending on the 						 Invoice Date  selected in the Summary area of the 					form. (By default, this box contains the business date.) The system creates 					invoices with a date that is the same as the  Invoice 						Date . The form does not show the projects with the 							 Next Billing Date , which is specified on the 							 Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, is later than the  Invoice Date , which in 						specified in the Selection area of the form. On both forms, the system bills only a project that is pending billing—that is, at 				least one of the following exist for the project: An unbilled transaction that is ready to be billed on the invoice date—that is, 					the date of the transaction is not later than the invoice date. The invoice 						date is the date of the invoice that the system creates during the billing. 						The invoice date depends on the form where you run billing as 						follows: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the invoice date is the 								 Next Billing Date , which is specified on the 								 Summary  tab, for all the projects except 							those that are billed on demand.

For the  Progress Billing  steps of the billing rules of project tasks 					whose processing does not involve allocations, the system generates an invoice 					with the billable project revenue, meaning the revenue budget lines with a 					nonzero  Pending Invoice Amount  listed on the 						 Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. For the billing process for a project to be run successfully, the project should meet 				the following criteria: All the mandatory settings should be specified for the project and its 					tasks. The project status should be  Active ,  Completed , or 						 Suspended . The status of the project tasks should be  Active  or  Completed , and 					the billing rule should be specified for these tasks. The project should have a provision for billing, such as a billable line of the 					revenue budget associated with the task for a progress billing, or an unbilled 					project transaction associated with the task within this billing period for a 					time and material billing.

You can also use different sources of the project rates: those 					from the rate tables that can be configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM206000|PM206000]) Rate Tables (PM206000) form, and those from sales price lists that are defined on the 						  ([~/?ScreenId=AR202000|AR202000]) Sales Prices (AR202000) form. The sources of the sales account and the destination branch for each invoice 						line. The billing process uses the originating branch from the project 						settings on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form and the 						destination branches from the sources according to the billing rules. When 						an Accounts Receivable invoice is released, the Accounts Receivable account 						is updated under the originating branch of the invoice, while the revenue 						amounts are recorded to the destination branches of the invoice 					lines. The invoice group to make the system create separate invoices for particular 					steps with the similar invoice group during the project billing (either pro 					forma invoices or Accounts Receivable invoices, depending on the billing 					workflow of the project). During the billing process, the system groups the 						billable amounts into invoices by the following: The invoice group of the steps of the billing rules to which the 								project tasks refer The customer The customer location The  Bill Separately  setting of each project 								task defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) 								form Non-billable transactions that do not contribute to the amount billed to the 					customer and that you may decide to include in the invoice. Grouping criteria by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item for the invoice 					lines created by the  Time and Material  billing steps. Formulas in Billing Rules In formulas of a billing rule, to retrieve the data, you can use the following data 				access classes: PMAccountGroup PMBudget PMProject PMTask PMTran Customer EPEmployee InventoryItem Vendor When you bill a project using a billing rule with a formula that uses the 					 PMBudget  data access class, for each budget line of the 				project, the system retrieves  PMBudget  records that are associated 				with the same project, project task, account group, inventory item, and cost code if 				the  Cost Code  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Progress Billing Progress billing is a simple billing workflow for the projects that are gradually 				billed at a fixed contract amount. Progress billing does not involve project 				transactions, and the system uses  Progress Billing  steps of billing rules of 				the project tasks to process this billing. The project setup and the billing 				workflow proceed as follows: A user adds a revenue budget line with a  Revised Amount  					to a project on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. To provide a billable amount (for example, on a monthly basis), the user populates the 						 Pending Invoice Amount  or  Completed 						(%)  column on the  Revenue Budget  tab for 					the revenue budget lines to make the system calculate the  Pending 						Invoice Amount  as follows: Pending Invoice Amount = 							Revised Budgeted Amount * ( Completed (%) / 100 ) - Draft Invoices 							Amount - Actual Amount The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an 					Accounts Receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow). The system creates an invoice with the amounts derived from the 						 Pending Invoice Amount  column of the 						 Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form for the revenue budget lines. The 					system updates the  Draft Invoices Amount  of the revenue 					budget lines with the  Pending Invoice Amount  and clears 					the  Pending Invoice Amount . If the system creates a pro forma invoice (depending on the selected workflow), 					the invoice lines that are produced by the progress billing steps are displayed 					on the  Progress Billing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. If a project task uses a billing rule that has no  Progress Billing  						step, when the system updates the  Completed (%)  						column on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system does not recalculate the 							 Pending Invoice Amount  column for the revenue 						budget lines that belong to this task, and the system ignores any pending 						invoice amount of these lines during the billing process. The  Actual Quantity  of the  Revenue 							Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) 						is always zero in the revenue budget lines that are billed only by progress 						billing. Transaction-Based Billing This billing workflow is provided for projects that are billed based on project 				transactions. The system uses the  Time and Material  steps of the billing 				rules of the project tasks to process this billing. A billing rule may have a number 				of  Time and Material  steps for different account groups of transactions that 				should be used to determine the invoiced amounts by different formulas. The  Time 					and Material  billing can be executed right after the project transactions 				that match the selection criteria have been provisioned in the system. The 				allocation process can be executed before billing, if necessary. The project setup and billing workflow proceeds as follows: The user runs the project billing process to create a pro forma invoice (or an 					Accounts Receivable invoice, depending on the selected workflow). The system creates the invoice based on the unbilled project transactions with 					amounts calculated by the billing rules of the project tasks. The system 						considers in the billing the transactions with a date that is earlier than 						the billing date and does not consider the transactions with the date that 						is later than the billing date. The transactions with a date on the billing 						date are billed if  Include Trans. created on billing date  is selected 						as the  Billing Cut-off Date  on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. If the system creates a pro forma invoice, the invoice lines that are produced 					by the  Time and Material  billing steps are displayed on the 						 Time and Material  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. Recurring Billing Your company may provide services to customers regularly for a flat price. For 				instance, you can lease construction machines to customers for an agreed number of 				hours per month for a fixed price. If you decide to manage this activity as a 				project, you do not have to manually create a new invoice every month—each time you 				run project billing, recurring transactions are added to the invoice (or to the 				invoice listed first in the rule if multiple invoices must be generated for the 				billing rule). Recurring billing is a task-level setting you define on the 					 Recurring Billing  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form. You can use non-stock 				items as line items for recurring billing to track employee and equipment work time. 				For each item, you can specify the following:  The flat price charged once each billing period. The number of units included in the item fee. For instance, you may have an 					agreement with the customer to provide 40 hours of road scraper work at a flat 					price, while any extra hours are charged on a per-hour basis. The option that determines whether the number of units included in the flat 					price is to be reset for each billing period or it is a fixed number for the 					entire project duration. For instance, with the agreement for 40 hours of road 					scraper work at a flat monthly price, you can use hour as the unit of measure 					and reset the number of hours each month to ensure that the customer gets their 					quota of 40 hours each month. In a different scenario, the agreement may imply 					the lease of one to three road scrapers to the customer at a flat monthly price 					(here, you use scraper as a unit of measure); in this case, you do not need to 					reset the number of scrapers each month. The minimum number of units for which billing may be performed. If the amount of 					services or products you provide is less than this value, you do not charge the 					customer. For instance, your agreement may stipulate a flat monthly price for 10 					to 40 hours of road scraper work. Any scraper time below 10 hours is not 					charged. The billing period is a project-wide setting that you specify when planning the 				project at the level of the project template on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates 				(PM208000) form. The following options are available:  Week ,  Month , 					 Quarter ,  Year , or  On Demand . The  On Demand  option 				defines the billing that may be initiated when it is needed. Billing of Postponed Amounts With the draft invoice workflow, a user can modify a pro forma invoice and postpone 				the difference until the next billing. This remaining amount will be billed during 				the next billing if the Accounts Receivable invoice that contains the line from 				which the remainder originates is released. For more information about the draft 				invoice workflow, see  Pro Forma Invoices. Reversing an Accounts Receivable Invoice When you reverse a released Accounts Receivable invoice that was created based on a 				project transaction, the system creates the corresponding credit memo. When you 				release this reversing credit memo, the system creates the non-billable reversing 				project transaction that reverses the impact of the original project transaction. 				The original project transaction remains billed. The system also creates a copy of 				the original project transaction with the original amount even if this amount was 				adjusted in the credit memo. The date and the financial period of this copied 				project transaction are the same as the date and the financial period of the credit 				memo. The copied project transaction is unbilled. Thus, as the result of such a 				reversal, there are the following project transactions in the system: The original project transaction, which is billed The non-billable reversing project transaction, which reverses the impact of the 					original project transaction The copy of the original project transaction, which is unbilled Mapping of Accounts to Tasks When you run a billing procedure for a project, the system may generate additional 				transactions—for instance, to include a discount or freight charge. Such 				transactions are automatically associated with the project, but you may also need to 				automatically associate these transactions with specific tasks in the project. You can have  Acumatica ERP automatically assign transactions to specific tasks by mapping specific General 				Ledger accounts to tasks within the project in the  Default Task for GL 					Account  section on the  GL Accounts  tab of the 					  ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. Once you map a 				General Ledger account to a task, any transactions automatically generated by the 				system and associated with the account will be linked to this default task. Project Billing in Migration Mode If Accounts Receivable is in migration mode—that is, the  Activate 					Migration Mode  check box is selected in the  Posting 					Settings  section of the  General Settings  tab 				on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR101000|AR101000]) Accounts Receivable Preferences (AR101000) form, the system does not create 				invoices during project billing. The creation of AR documents and pro forma invoices 				during project billing and the creation of AR documents during the release of pro 				forma invoices are not available. For more information on migration mode, see  Migrating Documents to Acumatica ERP.

 Acumatica ERP supports the tracking of purchase orders by project as project cost commitments. These commitments affect the execution status of a project. A user can track the budget and actual amounts of a project, as well as the original commitments that remain open. When the commitments are created, the system uses them to populate the cost budget for the corresponding project, project task, inventory item, and account group.[anchor|#section_akq_jg5_v1b]
==Tracking the Committed Cost by Purchase Order==
The system tracks the commitment cost in the base currency for the ''Normal'' and ''Drop-Ship'' lines of the purchase orders created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form and associated with a project. These commitments have the ''Internal'' type because they originate from documents created in the system, in contrast to commitments of the ''External'' type that can be imported into Acumatica ERP.{br}

The system tracks the internal commitment cost if the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check box is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.{br}

For a purchase order that refers to a project, when a user approves the purchase order or saves the purchase order with the ''Pending Printing'', ''Pending Email'', or ''Open'' status, the system creates a commitment record for each purchase order line in the amount of the '''Ext. Cost''' of the line. These commitments are updated when the order line is changed (for example, when the quantity or amount of the line is corrected or the order line is completed or canceled).{br}

Users can review the list of commitments on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form. The initial commitment amount is displayed in the '''Original Committed Amount''' column and the actual commitment amount is shown in the '''Revised Committed Amount''' column of each line. For a new commitment, the '''Committed Open Amount''' equals the revised committed amount.{br}

When a purchase order is received, the system updates the '''Committed Received Quantity''' and reduces the '''Committed Open Amount''' of the commitment line by an amount proportional to the received or billed quantity as follows: {{Committed Open Amount = Committed Open Amount − Revised Committed Amount * Committed Received Quantity / Revised Committed Quantity}}.{br}

The system updates the '''Committed Received Quantity''' of the commitment line depending on the type of the purchase order line as follows:[anchor|#ul_zqp_sf5_v1b]
*For the purchase order lines that are processed through a purchase receipt, the commitment lines are updated with the received quantity when the purchase receipt is released.
*For the purchase order lines that are billed directly without a purchase receipt being processed, the commitment lines are updated with the invoiced quantity when the Accounts Payable bill is released.

When an Accounts Payable bill that corresponds to the purchase order is released, the '''Committed Invoiced Amount''' is updated with the '''Ext. Cost''' of the bill line.{br}

After a purchase order has been closed, the '''Committed Open Amount''' of the commitment lines becomes zero. If a purchase order has been received partially or canceled, the incomplete amounts are also subtracted from the '''Committed Open Amount'''.{br}

The validate process on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_40_00|Validate Project Balances] ([~/?ScreenId=PM504000|PM504000]) form recreates internal commitment records based on the amounts and quantities in the lines of purchase orders if the tracking of project commitments is enabled.
==Updating the Document from Which a Commitment Originates==
Depending on the selection of the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box for a project in the '''Project Properties''' section ('''Summary''' tab) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, a purchase order that refers to the project can be updated in the following ways:[anchor|#ul_um2_r3j_ddb]
*If the check box is cleared—that is, the change order workflow is not enabled for the project—you update the purchase order directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. When you update the '''Ext. Cost''' of a purchase order line that refers to the project on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form and approve the purchase order or save the purchase order with the ''Pending Printing'', ''Pending Email'', or ''Open'' status, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] form, the system updates the '''Original Committed Amount''' and the '''Revised Committed Amount''' of the commitment that originates from the purchase order. The '''Committed CO Amount''' of the commitment, which is the difference between the '''Revised Committed Amount''' and the '''Original Committed Amount''', is zero.
*If the check box is selected—that is, the change order workflow is enabled for the project—and the project has at least one related change order, you update a purchase order line that refers to the project with a change order created for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form. When you release the change order, the system updates the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form and the '''Revised Committed Amount''' of the commitment that originates from the purchase order on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] form. The '''Original Committed Amount''' of the commitment remains the same. The '''Committed CO Amount''' of the commitment, which is the difference between the '''Revised Committed Amount''' and the '''Original Committed Amount''', shows the amount that was added to the commitment or subtracted from the commitment by the change order.
*If the check box is selected—that is, the change order workflow is enabled for the project—and the project has no related change orders, you still can update the purchase order directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. You can also update a purchase order line that refers to the project with a change order created for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form.

For more information about change orders, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Change_Management|Change Management].
==Retainage in Commitments==
If the ''Retainage Support'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, the following amounts of a commitment that originate from the purchase order line always include the retained amount on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form even if the corresponding purchase order line has the amount after retainage in the '''Amount''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form:[anchor|#ul_ghx_hqn_ldb]
*'''Original Committed Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.
*'''Committed Open Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Open Amount''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.
*'''Revised Committed Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.

The other commitment amounts are calculated based on the amounts listed above—that is, the commitment amounts include the retained amount if any.{br}

For more information about retainage, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__CON_Retainage_Projects|Retainage in Projects].[anchor|#section_ojx_jg5_v1b]
==Aggregating Committed Data for Reports==
The commitment data aggregated by the project budget line key (project, project task, inventory item, and account group—that is, {{Project ID}}, {{Project Task ID}}, {{Inventory ID}}, and {{Account Group ID}}, respectively) is available in the analytical reports and on the following forms:[anchor|#ul_cyp_sf5_v1b]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, in the corresponding columns on the '''Cost Budget''' tab. For a selected budget line, you can click '''View Commitments''' on the table toolbar to review the detailed commitment records on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_60_10|Row Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=CS206010|CS206010]) form, in the '''Amount Type''' box of the '''Data Source''' of a row, for row sets of the ''PM'' type.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_60_20|Column Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=CS206020|CS206020]) form, in the '''Amount Type''' box of the '''Data Source''' of a column, for column sets of the ''PM'' type.
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_60_30|Unit Sets] ([~/?ScreenId=CS206030|CS206030]) form, in the '''Amount Type''' box of the '''Data Source''' of a unit, for unit sets of the ''PM'' type.
[anchor|#section_dtb_kg5_v1b]
==Integrating Commitments with External Systems==
Project commitments do not necessarily have to originate from purchase orders that exist in the system. Users can import commitment records from an external system into Acumatica ERP for further analysis against budget and actual figures. These commitment records are called ''External'' in contrast to internal ones that originate from documents created in the system. After the initial import, users can update imported commitment records as the project goes on and the system changes the applicable open committed amounts and invoiced amounts. Imported commitment records have the ''External'' type on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form and are identified in Acumatica ERP by the external reference number.{br}

The selection of the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form is not necessary for the import of external commitment records.{br}

To create an external commitment record, on the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] form, a user can click '''Create External Commitment''' and then populate the necessary settings of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_90_00|External Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209000|PM209000]) form, which opens. This form is also available for writing import and export scenarios and through the Web Services API.

Updating the Document from Which a Commitment Originates Depending on the selection of the  Change Order Workflow  check box         for a project in the  Project Properties  section           ( Summary  tab) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000)         form, a purchase order that refers to the project can be updated in the following ways: If the check box is cleared—that is, the change order workflow is not enabled for the           project—you update the purchase order directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders           (PO301000) form. When you update the  Ext. Cost  of a purchase           order line that refers to the project on the  Document Details  tab           of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form and approve the purchase order or save the           purchase order with the  Pending Printing ,  Pending Email , or  Open            status, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments form, the system updates the              Original Committed Amount  and the  Revised Committed             Amount  of the commitment that originates from the purchase order. The              Committed CO Amount  of the commitment, which is the difference           between the  Revised Committed Amount  and the  Original             Committed Amount , is zero. If the check box is selected—that is, the change order workflow is enabled for the           project—and the project has at least one related change order, you update a purchase order           line that refers to the project with a change order created for the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form. When you release the change order, the system           updates the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form and the              Revised Committed Amount  of the commitment that originates from           the purchase order on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments form. The  Original             Committed Amount  of the commitment remains the same. The              Committed CO Amount  of the commitment, which is the difference           between the  Revised Committed Amount  and the  Original             Committed Amount , shows the amount that was added to the commitment or           subtracted from the commitment by the change order. If the check box is selected—that is, the change order workflow is enabled for the           project—and the project has no related change orders, you still can update the purchase           order directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. You can also update           a purchase order line that refers to the project with a change order created for the           project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form. For more information about change orders, see  Change Management. Retainage in Commitments If the  Retainage Support  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form, the following amounts of a commitment that         originate from the purchase order line always include the retained amount on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form even if the corresponding purchase order line         has the amount after retainage in the  Amount  column on the            Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders         (PO301000) form: Original Committed Amount : The amount originates from the              Ext. Cost  of the purchase order line that includes the retained           amount. Committed Open Amount : The amount originates from the              Open Amount  of the purchase order line that includes the retained           amount. Revised Committed Amount : The amount originates from the              Ext. Cost  of the purchase order line that includes the retained           amount. The other commitment amounts are calculated based on the amounts listed above—that is, the         commitment amounts include the retained amount if any. For more information about retainage, see  Retainage in Projects. Aggregating Committed Data for Reports The commitment data aggregated by the project budget line key (project, project task,         inventory item, and account group—that is,  Project ID ,  Project Task           ID ,  Inventory ID , and  Account Group ID ,         respectively) is available in the analytical reports and on the following forms: On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, in the corresponding columns on           the  Cost Budget  tab. For a selected budget line, you can click              View Commitments  on the table toolbar to review the detailed           commitment records on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS206010|CS206010]) Row Sets (CS206010) form, in the  Amount             Type  box of the  Data Source  of a row, for row sets of           the  PM  type. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS206020|CS206020]) Column Sets (CS206020) form, in the  Amount             Type  box of the  Data Source  of a column, for column           sets of the  PM  type.

Integrating Commitments with External Systems Project commitments do not necessarily have to originate from purchase orders that exist in         the system. Users can import commitment records from an external system into  Acumatica ERP for further analysis against budget and actual figures. These commitment records are         called  External  in contrast to internal ones that originate from documents created in         the system. After the initial import, users can update imported commitment records as the         project goes on and the system changes the applicable open committed amounts and invoiced         amounts. Imported commitment records have the  External  type on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form and are identified in  Acumatica ERP by the external reference number. The selection of the  Internal Cost Commitment Tracking  check box on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form is not necessary for the import of         external commitment records.

 Acumatica ERP supports project quotes, which you can enter and modify on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form. A project quote is used to estimate a potential project and send a proposal to the customer before a project is created in the system for billing and accounting of revenues and costs. Each modification of a project quote can be printed and sent to the customer for review, and you can modify the quote as many times as is necessary until an agreement is reached. Optionally, you can set up an approval workflow for project quotes so that a manager can approve each modification of a quote before it is sent to the customer. After the customer agrees to the terms of the quote, you can convert the winning quote to a project.{br}

The functionality of project quotes is available only if the ''Project Quotes'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.{br}

If the ''Customer Management'' feature is also enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form, a project quote can be created based on an opportunity that has been created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form.[anchor|#section_i3l_d4p_mcb]
==Project Quote Workflow==
The project quote workflow may include the following stages, which are described in the remaining sections of this topic and shown in the diagram below:[anchor|#ol_i13_11l_n2b]
#Creating a project quote.
#:You can start on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form or use an opportunity on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form as a starting point and create a quote for the opportunity.
#Submitting the quote.
#Optionally, obtaining approval for the quote.
#Sending the approved quote to the customer for agreement.
#Changing the quote after negotiations with the customer.
#:To keep the history of proposals, you can create a new project quote and make changes to it instead of changing the original project quote. Optionally, project quotes can be linked to an opportunity and you can see the history of proposals in the scope of each opportunity.
#Converting the quote to a project.

==Project Quote Creation==
You generally use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form as a starting point to create a project quote.{br}

For a new project quote, you can specify the following settings:[anchor|#ul_fsf_yfs_p2b]
*The description of the project quote.
*The project template, which the system uses to populate the project tasks, attributes, and project manager of the project quote. You can change these default settings, if needed.
*:If you first specify the tasks, attributes, and project manager of the project quote, and then select the project template, you can either replace your specified settings with the settings of the project template or leave your specified settings.
*The business account associated with the project quote.
*:Based on the settings specified for the selected business account, on the '''Billing Information''' tab, the system populates the contact information and the financial details. You can override these settings, if needed.
*Project tasks on the '''Project Tasks''' tab.
*The estimation of labor and material costs and prices on the '''Estimation''' tab. If you convert the project quote to a project, the system populates the revenue and cost budget of the project based on the settings specified on this tab.
*Activities related to the project quote on the '''Activities''' tab.

You can also create a project quote by selecting an existing project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form and then invoking the '''Copy Quote''' action on the form toolbar. The system opens the '''Copy Quote''' dialog box, where you can define the settings the system will use when copying the project quote. When you click '''OK''' in the dialog box, the system creates a copy of the project quote based on the settings specified in the dialog box.{br}

You can also create a project quote based on a particular opportunity that is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form. For more information, see the [[#_82f9bfae-4548-4a6b-8b59-54795eefd6a4|Integration Between Opportunities, Sales Quotes, and Project Quotes] section of this topic.[anchor|#section_xv2_f1w_mcb]
==Project Quote Approval==
A project quote supports the standard Acumatica ERP approval process. The approval map can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form and then specified in the '''Quote Approval Map''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. The approval notification for project quotes can be specified in the '''Quote Pending Approval Notification''' box on the same form.{br}

The approval process is optional; the configuration of the approval process can be skipped and a user can create a project quote that is processed without the step of approval.[anchor|#section_vgz_15w_mcb]
==Printing of a Project Quote ==
You can print a project quote with any status. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, you can print the selected project quote by clicking '''Actions''' > '''Print Quote''' on the form toolbar.{br}

For the printing of project quotes, the system uses the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_60_45_00|Project Quote] ([~/?ScreenId=PM604500|PM604500]) report. This report supports the printing of estimation lines, the header-level note, and the detailed description of a project quote.{br}

On the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form, you can specify the contact information of the customer to whom the project quote should be sent.[anchor|#section_spq_ggr_y2b]
==Emailing of a Project Quote==
You can email a submitted and approved (if approval of project quotes is set up in the system) project quote to the customer for review if the status of the project quote is ''Prepared'' or ''Sent''. To do this, you select the quote and then invoke the '''Send Quote''' action on the form toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form. In this case, an email activity is created and listed on the '''Activities''' tab of the form, the quote is attached to the email activity (in the form of a report) and sent to the recipient, and the status of the quote is changed to ''Sent''.{br}

The email address of the recipient is taken from the contact information specified on the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form.{br}

The system generates the email in accordance with the settings of the ''PMQUOTE'' mailing of the project template selected for the project quote. The settings of the project template on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form are copied from the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form and can be overridden.{br}

For the ''PMQUOTE'' mailing of each project template, you could change the following settings:[anchor|#ul_ncf_bfw_hdb]
*The email address from which the mailing will be sent; if none is specified, the system will use the default system email account
*The notification template based on which the email body will be generated
*The report that will be attached to the email and the format of the attachment
[anchor|#section_kcj_x42_p2b]
==Creation of a Project Based on a Project Quote==
A project quote with the ''Prepared'' or ''Sent'' status can be converted to a project. Before you convert the project quote, the following settings should be specified for it in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form:[anchor|#ul_ejx_dpv_q2b]
*'''Project Template''': The template to be used for the creation of the project
*'''Business Account''': The customer of the project
*'''New Project ID''': The identifier of the project

If the project quote has been created based on an opportunity (that is, the project quote has an opportunity selected in the '''Opportunity ID''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form), the project quote should also be the primary quote of the opportunity (that is, the '''Primary''' check box should be selected in the Summary area of the same form).{br}

For a project quote that satisfies these basic requirements, on the toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form, you can click '''Convert to Project''' to convert the project quote to a project. The system opens the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box, where you can define the settings to be used for the project creation. When you click '''OK''' in the dialog box, the system creates a project based on the project quote and the settings specified in the dialog box, using the rules described in the next section.{br}

Once a project quote is converted to a project, the quote is assigned the ''Closed'' status and cannot be modified. If you delete the project, the system assigns the ''Prepared'' status to the project quote so you can again create a project based on the modified quote, if needed.
==Settings and Rules a Project Created Based on a Project Quote==
When the system creates a project based on the project quote,the settings of the created project in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form are populated with the following settings of the project quote:[anchor|#ul_n35_h4k_y2b]
*'''Project ID''': If auto-numbering has not been configured for project quotes, the system fills this box with the '''New Project ID''' value specified for the project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form. Otherwise, the project identifier is assigned automatically.
*'''Customer''': This box is filled with the business account selected for the project quote.
*'''Template''': This box is left empty. The project template reference is not copied from the project quote to the project to avoid confusion, because a project that is created based on a project quote with a project template specified can have a very different structure of project tasks and the project budget than a project that is created directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form based on the same project template.
*'''Description''': The system fills this box with description of the project quote.
*'''Status''': The status of the new project is ''Active'' if the '''Activate Project''' check box has been selected in the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box used to convert the project task to a project. Otherwise, the status is ''In Planning''.

When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the settings on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, it uses the corresponding settings of the following sources:[anchor|#ul_dkn_mrk_y2b]
*'''Revenue Budget Level''': The project template specified for the project quote on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form
*'''Start Date''': The business date of the project quote
*'''Project Manager''': The project quote
*'''Restrict Employees''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Restrict Equipment''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Track Production Data''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Billing Period''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Allocation Rule''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Run Allocation on Release of Project Transactions''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Billing Rule''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Branch''': The project quote
*'''Rate Table''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Create Pro Forma on Billing''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Automatically Release AR Documents''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Retainage %''': The business account of the project quote
*'''Customer Location''': The location of the project quote on the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form
*'''Bill-To''' section: The contact information of the project quote on the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form
*'''Bill-To Address''' section: The address of the project quote on the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form
*'''Visibility Settings''' section: The project template specified for the project quote

When the system creates a project based on the project quote, it populates the tasks on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form using the following rules:[anchor|#ul_xgw_1vk_y2b]
*If the project quote has two or more tasks, these tasks are copied to the project. In this case, if the project quote does not have a default task, the created project does not have the default task either.
*If the project quote has only one task, this task is copied to the project and marked as the default task of the project even if the task has not been marked as the default task of the project quote.
*If the project quote has no tasks, the system creates a default project task for the project—that is, a task with the ''0'' identifier and ''Default'' description.
*The status of the created project tasks is ''Active'' if the '''Activate Tasks''' check box has been selected in the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box during the conversion process. Otherwise, the status is ''In Planning''.
*The location of the created tasks is the location of the project quote from the '''Billing Information''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] form.
*If the project quote has only one task or does not have any task at all and some or all the estimation lines of the project quote have no project task assigned, the system assigns the default task of the project to the cost budget and revenue budget lines of the project that it creates based on these estimation lines.

When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the revenue budget, the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote by the following entities, depending on the revenue budget level of the project template specified for the project quote. This setting is specified in the '''Revenue Budget Level''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form:[anchor|#ul_zcw_csv_q2b]
*''Task'': The estimation lines are aggregated by project task and revenue account group.
*''Task and Item'': The estimation lines are grouped by project task, revenue account group, and inventory item.
*''Task and Cost Code'': The estimation lines are grouped by project task, revenue account group, and cost code.

For each group of estimation lines, on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system creates a revenue budget line with the following settings:[anchor|#ul_ckd_5qv_q2b]
*'''Project Task''': The system uses the project task of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Inventory ID''': The system uses the inventory item of the aggregated estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are aggregated into a cost budget line with the empty item code, which is defined in the '''Empty Item Code''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
*'''Account Group''': The system uses the revenue account group of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Description''': Depending on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the revenue budget line:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the description of the cost budget line is ''Aggregated: Account Group Description'', where ''Account Group Description'' is the description of the account group by which the group of estimation lines has been aggregated.
*'''Original Budgeted Quantity''': The system inserts the total quantity of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is zero.
*'''UOM''': The system uses the UOM of aggregated estimation lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise the UOM is empty.
*'''Unit Rate''': The calculation of the unit rate of the revenue budget line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of this line is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit rate as the total '''Amount''' of the lines divided by the total quantity of the lines.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have different UOM values,the unit rate of the revenue budget line is zero.
*'''Original Budgeted Amount''': The system inserts the total amount of the aggregated lines.
*'''Tax Category''': The tax category of the revenue budget line depends on the tax category of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the tax category of this line is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and all the lines have the same tax category, this tax category is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have either the same tax category or an empty tax category, the specified tax category is copied to the revenue budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have at least two different tax categories, the tax category of the revenue budget line is empty.

When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the cost budget, the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote by project task, inventory item, cost code, and cost account group. For each group of estimation lines, on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system creates a cost budget line with the following settings:[anchor|#ul_cxz_hqv_q2b]
*'''Project Task''': The system inserts the project task of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Inventory ID''': The system uses the inventory item of the aggregated estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are aggregated into a cost budget line with the empty item code, which is defined in the '''Empty Item Code''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form.
*'''Account Group''': The system inserts the cost account group of the aggregated estimation lines.
*'''Description''': Depending on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the cost budget line:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the description of the cost budget line is ''Aggregated: Account Group Description'', where ''Account Group Description'' is the description of the account group by which the group of estimation lines has been aggregated.
*'''Original Budgeted Quantity''': The system inserts the total quantity of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is zero.
*'''UOM''': The system uses the UOM of the aggregated estimation lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the UOM is empty.
*'''Unit Rate''': The calculation of the unit rate of the cost budget line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit rate of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the system calculates the unit rate as the total '''Ext. Cost''' of lines that have a nonzero quantity divided by the total quantity of these lines. The lines of the group with the zero quantity or zero '''Ext. Cost''' are ignored in the calculation.
*'''Original Budgeted Amount''': The system calculates this amount as the total extended cost of the aggregated lines.
*'''Unit Price''': The calculation of the unit price of the cost budget line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows:
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of this line is copied to the cost budget line.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit price as the total '''Amount''' of the lines divided by the total quantity of the lines.
**If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the lines have different UOM values, the unit price of the cost budget line is zero.

The project settings on the following tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form are copied from the following sources:[anchor|#ul_kzp_3wp_y2b]
*'''Activity History''': The project quote if the '''Link Activities to Project''' check box has been selected in the '''Convert to Project''' dialog box during conversion
*'''Equipment''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''GL Accounts''': The project template specified for the project quote
*'''Attributes''': The project quote
*'''Mailing Settings''': The project template specified for the project quote

In a project created based on a project quote, the reference to the project quote is displayed in the '''Quote Ref. Nbr.''' box of the '''Quote''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.[anchor|#_82f9bfae-4548-4a6b-8b59-54795eefd6a4]
==Integration Between Opportunities, Sales Quotes, and Project Quotes==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, for the selected opportunity, a user can create a project quote or a sales quote in any of the following ways:[anchor|#ul_mvv_xgq_ncb]
*By clicking '''Create Quote''' on the form toolbar
*By clicking '''Create Quote''' on the table toolbar of the '''Quotes''' tab
*By selecting an existing quote on the '''Quotes''' tab and then invoking the '''Copy Quote''' action on the table toolbar; in this case, a copy of the selected quote is created

On the '''Quotes''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, the user can review all the quotes linked to the selected opportunity. The tab lists both project quotes and sales quotes. The primary quote of the opportunity is the quote for which the check box in the '''Primary''' column is selected. If a project quote is the primary project quote of an opportunity, the project quote reflects the opportunity value in sales reports. However, the details of the project quote and the actions applicable to the quote are not reflected in the opportunity.{br}

With the linked opportunity and project quote, the user can do the following:[anchor|#ul_ofr_42r_r2b]
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, create a copy of the quote selected on the '''Quotes''' tab
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, mark the quote selected on the '''Quotes''' tab as the primary quote
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, print the quote selected on the '''Quotes''' tab
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, send the quote selected on the '''Quotes''' tab, which creates the corresponding activity and updates the quote status to ''Sent''
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, make the primary quote available for editing, which updates the status of the quote to ''Draft''
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] form, submit the primary quote, which updates the status of the quote to ''Prepared''
*On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, remove the opportunity with the ''New'' or ''Open'' status from a project quote if the project quote is not the primary quote for the opportunity

A user can find all the project and sales quotes on the All Quotes (PM3045PL) form.

For a new project quote, you can specify the following settings: The description of the project quote. The project template, which the system uses to populate the project tasks, attributes,           and project manager of the project quote. You can change these default settings, if             needed. If you first specify the tasks, attributes, and project manager of the project             quote, and then select the project template, you can either replace your specified             settings with the settings of the project template or leave your specified           settings. The business account associated with the project quote. Based on the settings              specified             for the selected business account , on the  Billing               Information  tab, the system populates the contact information and the             financial details. You can override these settings, if needed. Project tasks on the  Project Tasks  tab. The estimation of labor and material costs and prices on the              Estimation  tab. If you convert the project quote to a project,           the system populates the revenue and cost budget of the project based on the settings           specified on this tab. Activities related to the project quote on the  Activities            tab. You can also create a project quote by selecting an existing project quote on the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes form and then invoking the  Copy           Quote  action on the form toolbar. The system opens the  Copy           Quote  dialog box, where you can define the settings the system will use when         copying the project quote. When you click  OK  in the dialog box, the         system creates a copy of the project quote based on the settings specified in the dialog         box. You can also create a project quote based on a particular opportunity that is selected on         the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities         (CR304000) form. For more information, see the  Integration Between Opportunities, Sales Quotes, and Project Quotes Integration Between Opportunities, Sales Quotes, and Project Quotes section of this topic. Project Quote Approval A project quote supports the standard  Acumatica ERP approval process. The approval map can be configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205500)         form and then specified in the  Quote Approval Map  box on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. The approval notification for         project quotes can be specified in the  Quote Pending Approval           Notification  box on the same form. The approval process is optional; the configuration of the approval process can be skipped         and a user can create a project quote that is processed without the step of approval. Printing of a Project Quote  You can print a project quote with any status. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes         (PM304500) form, you can print the selected project quote by clicking  Actions Print Quote  on the form toolbar. For the printing of project quotes, the system uses the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM604500|PM604500]) Project Quote         (PM604500) report. This report supports the printing of estimation lines, the header-level         note, and the detailed description of a project quote. On the  Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes form, you can specify the contact information of the customer to whom the project quote         should be sent. Emailing of a Project Quote You can email a submitted and approved (if approval of project quotes is set up in the         system) project quote to the customer for review if the status of the project quote is            Prepared  or  Sent . To do this, you select the quote and then invoke the            Send Quote  action on the form toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form. In this case, an email activity is created and         listed on the  Activities  tab of the form, the quote is attached to         the email activity (in the form of a report) and sent to the recipient, and the status of         the quote is changed to  Sent . The email address of the recipient is taken from the contact information specified on the            Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes         form. The system generates the email in accordance with the settings of the  PMQUOTE          mailing of the project template selected for the project quote. The settings of the project         template on the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form are copied from the  Mailing           Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form and can be         overridden. For the  PMQUOTE  mailing of each project template, you could change the following         settings: The email address from which the mailing will be sent; if none is specified, the system           will use the default system email account The notification template based on which the email body will be generated The report that will be attached to the email and the format of the attachment Creation of a Project Based on a Project Quote A project quote with the  Prepared  or  Sent  status can be converted to a         project. Before you convert the project quote, the following settings should be specified         for it in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form: Project Template : The template to be used for the creation of the           project Business Account : The customer of the project New Project ID : The identifier of the project If the project quote has been created based on an opportunity (that is, the project quote         has an opportunity selected in the  Opportunity ID  box in the Summary         area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes form), the project quote should also be the         primary quote of the opportunity (that is, the  Primary  check box         should be selected in the Summary area of the same form). For a project quote that satisfies these basic requirements, on the toolbar of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes form, you can click  Convert to Project  to         convert the project quote to a project. The system opens the  Convert to           Project  dialog box, where you can define the settings to be used for the         project creation. When you click  OK  in the dialog box, the system         creates a project based on the project quote and the settings specified in the dialog box,         using the rules described in the next section. Once a project quote is converted to a project, the quote is assigned the  Closed          status and cannot be modified. If you delete the project, the system assigns the            Prepared  status to the project quote so you can again create a project based on the         modified quote, if needed. Settings and Rules a Project Created Based on a Project Quote When the system creates a project based on the project quote,the settings of the created         project in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000)         form are populated with the following settings of the project quote: Project ID : If auto-numbering has not been configured for project           quotes, the system fills this box with the  New Project ID  value           specified for the project quote on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes (PM304500) form.           Otherwise, the project identifier is assigned automatically. Customer : This box is filled with the business account selected           for the project quote. Template : This box is left empty. The project template reference           is not copied from the project quote to the project to avoid confusion, because a project           that is created based on a project quote with a project template specified can have a very           different structure of project tasks and the project budget than a project that is created           directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form based on the same           project template. Description : The system fills this box with description of the           project quote. Status : The status of the new project is  Active  if the              Activate Project  check box has been selected in the              Convert to Project  dialog box used to convert the project task to           a project. Otherwise, the status is  In Planning . When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the settings on         the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form, it uses the corresponding settings of the following sources: Revenue Budget Level : The project template specified for the           project quote on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes form Start Date : The business date of the project quote Project Manager : The project quote Restrict Employees : The project template specified for the           project quote Restrict Equipment : The project template specified for the           project quote Track Production Data : The project template specified for the           project quote Billing Period : The project template specified for the project           quote Allocation Rule : The project template specified for the project           quote Run Allocation on Release of Project Transactions : The project           template specified for the project quote Billing Rule : The project template specified for the project           quote Branch : The project quote Rate Table : The project template specified for the project           quote Create Pro Forma on Billing : The project template specified for           the project quote Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits : The project template specified           for the project quote Automatically Release AR Documents : The project template           specified for the project quote Retainage % : The business account of the project quote Customer Location : The location of the project quote on the              Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes           form Bill-To  section: The contact information of the project quote on           the  Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes           form Bill-To Address  section: The address of the project quote on the              Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes           form Visibility Settings  section: The project template specified for           the project quote When the system creates a project based on the project quote, it populates the tasks on the            Tasks  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form         using the following rules: If the project quote has two or more tasks, these tasks are copied to the project. In           this case, if the project quote does not have a default task, the created project does not           have the default task either. If the project quote has only one task, this task is copied to the project and marked as           the default task of the project even if the task has not been marked as the default task           of the project quote. If the project quote has no tasks, the system creates a default project task for the           project—that is, a task with the  0  identifier and  Default  description. The status of the created project tasks is  Active  if the  Activate             Tasks  check box has been selected in the  Convert to             Project  dialog box during the conversion process. Otherwise, the status is              In Planning . The location of the created tasks is the location of the project quote from the              Billing Information  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes           form. If the project quote has only one task or does not have any task at all and some or all           the estimation lines of the project quote have no project task assigned, the system           assigns the default task of the project to the cost budget and revenue budget lines of the           project that it creates based on these estimation lines. When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the revenue         budget, the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote by the following         entities, depending on the revenue budget level of the project template specified for the         project quote. This setting is specified in the  Revenue Budget Level          box on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) Project Templates (PM208000) form: Task : The estimation lines are aggregated by project task and revenue account           group. Task and Item : The estimation lines are grouped by project task, revenue account           group, and inventory item. Task and Cost Code : The estimation lines are grouped by project task, revenue           account group, and cost code. For each group of estimation lines, on the  Revenue Budget  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system creates a revenue budget         line with the following settings: Project Task : The system uses the project task of the aggregated           estimation lines. Inventory ID : The system uses the inventory item of the           aggregated estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are           aggregated into a cost budget line with the empty item code, which is defined in the              Empty Item Code  box on the  General             Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000)           form. Account Group : The system uses the revenue account group of the           aggregated estimation lines. Description : Depending on the number of aggregated estimation           lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the revenue budget             line: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the               description of the cost budget line is  Aggregated: Account Group Description ,               where  Account Group Description  is the description of the account group by               which the group of estimation lines has been aggregated. Original Budgeted Quantity : The system inserts the total quantity           of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is           zero. UOM : The system uses the UOM of aggregated estimation lines if           each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise the UOM is empty. Unit Rate : The calculation of the unit rate of the revenue budget           line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in a group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of               this line is copied to the revenue budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each               of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit rate as the total                  Amount  of the lines divided by the total quantity of the               lines. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have different UOM values,the unit rate of the revenue budget line is zero. Original Budgeted Amount : The system inserts the total amount of           the aggregated lines. Tax Category : The tax category of the revenue budget line depends           on the tax category of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the tax category               of this line is copied to the revenue budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and all               the lines have the same tax category, this tax category is copied to the revenue               budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have either the same tax category or an empty tax category, the specified tax               category is copied to the revenue budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have at least two different tax categories, the tax category of the revenue               budget line is empty. When the system creates a project based on the project quote, to populate the cost budget,         the system groups the estimation lines of the project quote by project task, inventory item,         cost code, and cost account group. For each group of estimation lines, on the            Cost Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form, the system creates a cost budget line with the following settings: Project Task : The system inserts the project task of the           aggregated estimation lines. Inventory ID : The system uses the inventory item of the           aggregated estimation lines. Estimation lines without an inventory item specified are           aggregated into a cost budget line with the empty item code, which is defined in the              Empty Item Code  box on the  General             Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences form. Account Group : The system inserts the cost account group of the           aggregated estimation lines. Description : Depending on the number of aggregated estimation           lines in a group, the system assigns the following description to the cost budget line: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the description of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the               description of the cost budget line is  Aggregated: Account Group Description ,               where  Account Group Description  is the description of the account group by               which the group of estimation lines has been aggregated. Original Budgeted Quantity : The system inserts the total quantity           of the aggregated lines if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the quantity is           zero. UOM : The system uses the UOM of the aggregated estimation lines           if each of the lines has the same UOM. Otherwise, the UOM is empty. Unit Rate : The calculation of the unit rate of the cost budget           line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit rate of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines, the               system calculates the unit rate as the total  Ext. Cost  of lines               that have a nonzero quantity divided by the total quantity of these lines. The lines               of the group with the zero quantity or zero  Ext. Cost  are               ignored in the calculation. Original Budgeted Amount : The system calculates this amount as           the total extended cost of the aggregated lines. Unit Price : The calculation of the unit price of the cost budget           line depends on the number of aggregated estimation lines in the group as follows: If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of one line, the unit price of               this line is copied to the cost budget line. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and each               of these lines has the same UOM, the system calculates the unit price as the total                  Amount  of the lines divided by the total quantity of the               lines. If the group of aggregated estimation lines consists of two or more lines and the               lines have different UOM values, the unit price of the cost budget line is zero. The project settings on the following tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form are copied from the following sources: Activity History : The project quote if the  Link             Activities to Project  check box has been selected in the  Convert             to Project  dialog box during conversion Equipment : The project template specified for the project           quote GL Accounts : The project template specified for the project           quote Attributes : The project quote Mailing Settings : The project template specified for the project           quote In a project created based on a project quote, the reference to the project quote is         displayed in the  Quote Ref.

The tab lists both         project quotes and sales quotes. The primary quote of the opportunity is the quote for which         the check box in the  Primary  column is selected. If a project quote         is the primary project quote of an opportunity, the project quote reflects the opportunity         value in sales reports. However, the details of the project quote and the actions applicable         to the quote are not reflected in the opportunity.

The project management functionality in Acumatica ERP offers a new way of handling financial and management accounting in the company. By using projects, you can break corporate activity into separate units of work that are more relevant to the job and less complex. In the process, you gain valuable insight into what is happening within the company. {br}

A project in Acumatica ERP is a one-time endeavor with a defined start and end date, usually constrained by time and often limited in funding, deliverables, or both factors. For example, if your company builds residential houses, you might consider the process of building each house a separate project with its own budget, costs, and revenues. {br}{TOC}
==Projects ==
A project in Acumatica ERP can be viewed as a container for ''project tasks''. A project provides a unified environment, context, and scope for executing the tasks. For instance, a project specifies the date range, calendar, customer, resources (including employees and equipment), and modules that are integrated with the project. {br}

You can view and specify the settings of a particular project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. You can also track balances for account groups involved in the project, viewing budgeted, revised, and actual amounts. Each account group balance in a project is the total of all the corresponding amounts in the project tasks. That is, the project does not have any balances beyond those in the tasks of the project.
==Type of Projects==
You can use projects for tracking both in-house work and activities involving interaction with customers. An ''internal'' project is used to track activity completed within your company and for your company; for example, you can run an in-house training program as an internal project. Internal projects have budgets, do not include billing settings, and do not refer to any customer. {br}

An ''external'' project involves providing services and products to customers. An external project can be a ''fixed-price'' project or a ''cost-plus'' project in which the price is a percentage of the costs.
==Project Tasks==
A ''project task'' (or simply ''task'') is the smallest identifiable piece of work that is a part of the project. Tasks are used to identify different steps or activities within the project that are easily manageable, separable, traceable, and accountable. {br}

Tasks are always defined within the scope and limitations of a specific project. For instance, the task may not extend beyond the start and end dates of the project. Also, you may not make a task visible in the modules in which its parent project is not visible. You can, however, narrow or even disable the visibility of a task in the modules where the parent project ''is'' visible. A task includes the following settings, which are specific to each task and do not extend to the project: [anchor|#ul_txb_4gb_nr]
*'''Billing rule''': You can define the allocation and billing procedures for the particular task.
*'''Recurring billing''': You can stipulate the provision of services and products on a regular basis for a flat price.
*'''Status''': You can set the most appropriate status for each task. Thus, there is no correlation between the statuses of individual tasks in a given project.
*'''Percent completed''': Percent of task completion is used for revenue allocations. This is a unique property of tasks, since a percentage of completion for a project cannot be calculated in the current version. To work around this limitation, you can add a task that is used exclusively to track project progress. For each task, you can select the method of completion calculation:
**''Manual'': The percent of task completion is specified manually.
**''Budgeted Quantity'': The percent of completion is calculated automatically for the selected cost line (with the '''Production''' check box selected). The percent of task completion is calculated as actual quantity divided by the budgeted quantity for the selected line.
**''Budgeted Amount'': The percent of completion is calculated automatically for multiple cost lines (with the '''Production''' check box selected) as the total actual amount divided by the total budgeted amount. 
*'''Default''': You can assign one of the project tasks as the default one. On the data entry forms that support the selection of a project, the default project task is automatically populated when you selects the project.
*:You can select a task to be the default one for a project with the ''Active'' or ''In Planning'' status.

==Project and Task IDs==
As with other identifiers in Acumatica ERP, you can configure the project and task identifiers by configuring the segmented keys: ''PROJECT'' and ''PROTASK'', respectively. You can use the predefined configurations of the keys or you can configure the segmented keys as you need by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form. You can define how many segments each key will include, what values may be used, whether they should be validated, and whether auto-numbering should be used in one of the segments.

In Acumatica ERP, a project is a separate one-time or recurring endeavor with a specific scope, time frame, and budget. From its inception to completion, a project goes through the following stages: [anchor|#ul_rmk_5yq_qn]
*'''Planning''': During this stage, you specify project parameters, define tasks, add activities, and populate the project with employees, resources, and equipment. Each project once created is automatically assigned the ''In Planning'' status.
*'''Approval''': The project passes through this stage only if approval of projects is required in your system.
*'''Active''': During this stage, the project is executed, and it becomes visible in the integrated modules and available for posting transactions. 
*'''Completion''': Once the project is finished, it is assigned the ''Completed'' status. A project with the ''Completed'' status is no longer available for posting transactions. This is the final stage in the project life cycle.

These stages are described in greater detail below. {br}{TOC}
==Prerequisites==
Before you enter any new project in Acumatica ERP, you must ensure that the following are configured: 
*'''Account Groups''': Create and populate the account groups that will be used in the project. Account groups make it possible to transfer financial and non-financial information between the Projects module and other modules by associating transactions posted in other modules with your project.
*'''Rate Tables''': If your project uses a pricing model in which price may differ depending on multiple factors, such as task and inventory item, you need to define this model in Acumatica ERP by using rate tables that will provide rates for different sets of factors.
*'''Allocation Rules''': If your project uses a complex cost accrual model, you must specify appropriate allocation rules to correctly track project expenditures and future revenues.
*'''Billing Rules''': These rules define which of the transactions should be used for billing and which accounts should be used to record the transactions that are generated in the billing process.

==Planning Stage==
 Any new project you create in Acumatica ERP is automatically assigned the ''In Planning'' status. Before you make any project active or submit it for approval, you must thoroughly plan it and specify all the key properties. {br}

You can create a project either from scratch or from a template. Creating a project from scratch requires you to specify all the details. If you use a template, your new project will be populated with the template settings, and you need to enter only information that differs from (or is more specific than) the information in the template. {br}

When you are adding a new project by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you enter the following information: [anchor|#ul_uyr_kyw_2n]
*'''General Information''': This information includes the description, start date, end date, and billing period. You also select one of these billing options: on the date of the customer statement, at the end of each month, at the end of each quarter, or at the end of each year.
*'''Visibility Settings''': You can specify the modules with which you want to integrate your project. We recommend that you select only those modules that you will use to post documents related to your project.
*'''Tasks''': You can define the tasks for the project. A task in a project is a separate work unit with its own life cycle, budget, cost, and revenue.
*'''Employees''': You specify the employees to be engaged in the project. You can override the default labor class specified for specific employees by defining different labor classes for regular working hours and for overtime hours.
*'''Equipment''': You can list the equipment to be used in the project. You can override the default run, standby, and suspend rates for specific equipment.
*'''Attributes''': You can specify attribute values for the project—if a group of attributes has been assigned to projects on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form—and for project tasks if a group of attributes has been assigned to tasks.

A project in the planning stage is not available for selection on data entry forms in other modules integrated with the Projects module. To projects and project tasks that are in the ''In Planning'' status, you can add activities by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) forms. For instance, you can add an employee task for planning budgets for project tasks while at the stage of project planning. However, the transactions generated for completed activities (if any) can not be released until the project gets the ''Active'' status.{br}

You may move a project to the active stage once such essential preparation steps as the following have been completed: [anchor|#ul_ayj_kzw_2n]
*Reaching an agreement with all the stakeholders, including customers and employees
*Estimating the budget for the project and the expenditures it will entail
*Preparing the equipment and materials required for the project

 After preparation has been completed, you can take the project off hold by clearing the '''On Hold''' check box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form and saving it. If approval is not required in your system, the project becomes active. 
==Approval (Optional Stage)==
If projects in your organization should be approved before they can be used, the project gets the ''Pending Approval'' status once it is taken off hold. The project has this status until it is approved or rejected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form by an assigned employee. If approved, the project gets the ''Active'' status. If rejected, the project gets the ''Rejected'' status, which changes to ''In Planning'' once the project has been edited. For more information on approvals, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Project_Approval|Approval of Projects and Project-Related Activities].
==Active Stage==
Active projects become available for selection on the forms of the modules you have selected for integration with the Projects module. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Integration_With_Other_Modules|Integration with Other Modules]. When users create transactions in the integrated modules, they can link the transactions with a specific project task by specifying the project and task. Also, they can specify whether the transaction is billable for the project task. If users do not want to link a transaction with any project, they can specify the non-project code. {br}

Budget changes often occur during the course of the project. In Acumatica ERP, you cannot change the initial budget, although you can enter the revised figures for the project budget. The revised budget appears in a separate column. 
==Completion of Project==
A project life cycle ends when the project is either completed or closed. The project is considered completed when all its tasks are completed; this is the normal end of a project life. You complete the project by assigning it the ''Completed'' status. {br}

A project may end prematurely when the customer stops using the services your company provides. In that case, you can close the project before completing all its tasks. You complete the project by assigning it the ''Closed'' status.

Planning Stage  Any new project you create in  Acumatica ERP is automatically assigned the  In Planning  status. Before you make any                 project active or submit it for approval, you must thoroughly plan it and specify                 all the key properties.  You can create a project either from scratch or from a template. Creating a project                 from scratch requires you to specify all the details. If you use a template, your                 new project will be populated with the template settings, and you need to enter only                 information that differs from (or is more specific than) the information in the                 template.  When you are adding a new project by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects                 (PM301000) form, you enter the following information:  General Information : This information includes the description, start                     date, end date, and billing period. You also select one of these billing                     options: on the date of the customer statement, at the end of each month, at the                     end of each quarter, or at the end of each year. Visibility Settings : You can specify the modules with which you want to                     integrate your project. We recommend that you select only those modules that you                     will use to post documents related to your project. Tasks : You can define the tasks for the project. A task in a project is a                     separate work unit with its own life cycle, budget, cost, and revenue. Employees : You specify the employees to be engaged in the project. You                     can override the default labor class specified for specific employees by                     defining different labor classes for regular working hours and for overtime                     hours.

A project in the planning stage is not available for selection on data entry forms in                 other modules integrated with the Projects module. To projects and project tasks                 that are in the  In Planning  status, you can add activities by using the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) and   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks                 (PM302000) forms. For instance, you can add an employee task for planning budgets                 for project tasks while at the stage of project planning. However, the transactions                 generated for completed activities (if any) can not be released until the project                 gets the  Active  status.

If                 approved, the project gets the  Active  status. If rejected, the project gets                 the  Rejected  status, which changes to  In Planning  once the project has                 been edited. For more information on approvals, see  Approval of Projects and Project-Related Activities.

You can create an approval map by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form; in the map, you can specify conditions for assigning projects to specific workgroups and particular employees for approval. {br}

If approval of projects is configured, once a user takes a project off hold, the system assigns the project the ''Pending Approval'' status and uses the rules defined by the approval map to assign the project to a workgroup or to a particular employee (in the workgroup) for approval. If no assignment occurs, the project gets the ''Active'' status. {br}

Once the project is assigned to a workgroup, any member of the workgroup can view the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_30_10|Approvals] ([~/?ScreenId=EP503010|EP503010]) form and approve or reject it. If the project is rejected, it gets the ''Rejected'' status, which changes to ''In Planning'' once the project has been edited. {br}

An approved project gets the ''Active'' status and becomes visible when users record project-related transactions in the modules that are integrated with the Projects module.
==Approval of Time Activities==
To control completion of projects, you can assign a ''project manager'' to each project by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the same project manager will be assigned to most projects that are based on the same template, you can assign the project manager to the template on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. The project manager is authorized to approve any time activities related to the project by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_10|Approve Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) form.{br}

Once a project has been activated and approved, users can use project tasks to account for the time they worked on the project. For each project task, you can assign an approver—an employee who is authorized to approve time activities filed by employees working on the project. For a common task (a typical task not associated with any particular project template) added to the project, you can assign an approver on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_30|Common Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208030|PM208030]) form. For project-specific tasks, you can assign an approver to each task by using the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. {br}

An employee appointed to be the approver of specific tasks can view the time activities associated with these tasks on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_50_70_10|Approve Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP507010|EP507010]) form. On this form, the project manager can view all the activities associated with all tasks of the project. The approver or project manager can apply a filter to the list of activities to find specific activities and to then approve or reject all of the listed activities.

A project task (or simply ''task'') is the smallest identifiable piece of work that is a part of the project. Some tasks may require more than one financial period to complete and may be billed on task completion or even on completion of the entire project. Often, the allocation rules for projects are rather straightforward and use the percentage-of-completion scheme to evaluate the revenue earned during a specific financial period. {br}

This topic describes the methods that can be used to evaluate or calculate the percentage of task completion.
==Methods of Calculation of Task Completion Percentage==
For each task in the project, you can select which method will be used to evaluate the completion percentage of the task, which is shown in the '''Completed (%)''' column on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. You select the method in the '''Completion Calculation Method''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. You can select one of the following options:[anchor|#ul_hbz_rqj_cr]
*''Manual'': You can use this method if it is not possible to select one cost line in which the actual amount or quantity would reflect the overall task progress. This may be the case if different cost lines are expressed as quantities measured in different UOMs, or some of the lines have budgets expressed as amounts with other line budgets expressed as quantities. With this method, you evaluate the task progress by using all the available information and manually specify the task completion percentage in the '''Completed (%)''' box. You can change the value as often as needed and we recommend that you update it before you perform an allocation for the project.
*''Budgeted Quantity'': With this method, the system calculates the task completion percentage for all cost budget lines associated with the task for which the '''Auto Completed (%)''' check box is selected on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. The system calculates the percentage based on the quantities in the '''Actual Quantity''' and '''Revised Quantity''' columns on the '''Cost Budget''' tab by using the following formula: {{Completed (%) = Actual Quantity / Revised Quantity}}.
*:((({S:Hint}If the '''Auto Completed (%)''' check box is selected for more than one cost budget line associated with the task with this completion method, the result of the '''Completed (%)''' calculation can be unpredictable due to different UOMs of the cost budget lines. We strongly recommended that you use this method only if the task has a cost budget line whose actual quantity reflects the task&rsquo;s overall progress, so that you can select the '''Auto Completed (%)''' check box for only this cost budget line.
)))
*:For example, suppose that a task has a budget for 100 hours of consulting (with a cost of $100 per hour) for a customer company and a budget for 25 round trips (with a cost of $10 per hour) to the customer location. If you select the consulting cost for tracking the task completion, with 40 hours of consulting completed, the percentage of the task completion is calculated as 40%. Splitting or merging consulting sessions may change the number of required round trips; however, the task progress should be measured by the actual hours of consulting performed.
*''Budgeted Amount'': You can use this method for a task if all cost lines have budgeted amounts. With this method selected, the system calculates the task completion percentage for all the cost budget lines associated with the task for which the '''Auto Completed (%)''' check box is selected on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. The system calculates the percentage based on the amounts in the '''Actual Amount''' and '''Revised Amount''' columns on the '''Cost Budget''' tab by using the following formula: {{Completed (%) = Actual Amount / Revised Amount}}.

==Evaluation of Project Completion Percentage==
With Acumatica ERP, you cannot directly track the completion percentage for the entire project although you can track completion for each of the project tasks. If needed, you can create a separate task (for instance, a task named ''Progress'') and use it exclusively to manually specify the project completion percentage that you evaluate by using all the information available about the progress of project tasks and project-related transactions.

 Acumatica ERP provides draft (pro forma) invoice capabilities for project billing. A pro forma invoice, which you can view on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, is isolated from the Accounts Receivable module. You can review and modify the billable transactions and amounts of the pro forma invoice before you prepare the Accounts Receivable invoice that is based on this pro forma invoice. A pro forma invoice can be printed and sent to a customer as many times as is necessary until an agreement is reached.{br}

Once all the necessary changes have been applied to the pro forma invoice, it can be approved and released. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates an Accounts Receivable invoice with all the information copied from the pro forma invoice. With this process, you minimize corrections in the Accounts Receivable module.{br}

Pro forma invoices provide the following capabilities:[anchor|#ul_sfp_r1d_pbb]
*On the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can define billing limit amounts for revenue budget lines of the project if the '''Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits''' check box is selected on the '''Summary''' tab of this form. The system applies these limit amounts to the pro forma invoices of the project. If an invoice exceeds a limit, on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form, the user receives a warning or an error message, depending on the '''Validate T&M Revenue Budget Limits''' setting on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form.
*You can configure an approval workflow for pro forma invoices that includes a sequence of approval steps based on a comprehensive approval map specified in the '''Pro Forma Approval Map''' box on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] form.
*You can use different formats of printable pro forma invoices, depending on the particular project. On the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, you can specify a custom format and an email notification template that should be used for the printing and emailing of the pro forma invoices prepared for that project.
*:Also, in the '''Bill-to Contact''' and '''Bill-to Address''' sections of the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, you can specify the contact information of the customer to whom the pro forma invoices should be sent. This information is copied to each pro forma invoice created for the project and can be modified at the invoice level.

==Creating a Pro Forma Invoice==
A pro forma invoice can be created only through the project billing process (and assigned a reference number only automatically). You cannot manually enter new pro forma invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form. By default, the system creates a pro forma invoice when you bill a project because the '''Create Pro Forma on Billing''' check box is initially selected on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. To disable the draft invoice workflow for a project, you can clear this check box—that is, to prevent the system from creating a pro forma invoice when you bill the project.{br}

For a pro forma invoice created for a project, the system records to the following tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form the lines to be billed:[anchor|#ul_udg_pwc_pbb]
*'''Progress Billing''': The system creates these lines by using the ''Progress Billing'' steps of billing rules specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form. The lines originate from the revenue budget of the project.
*'''Time and Material''' The system creates these lines by using the ''Time and Material'' steps of billing rules; the lines originate from the project transactions.
*:The ''Time and Material'' steps of billing rules support the aggregation of project transactions by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item. On the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form, you can select a line and then click '''View Transactions Details''' on the table toolbar to drill down to the list of project transactions based on which the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''' of the line have been calculated by the formula of the billing rule.

Fore more information about the billing process, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Billing_Procedure|Project Billing].
==Modifying a Pro Forma Invoice==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, you can edit a pro forma invoice when it is ''On Hold'', including the following:
*You can delete a line of the pro forma invoice to bill it later in the full amount.
*You can modify the pro forma invoice to bill any lines on the '''Progress Billing''' and '''Time and Material''' tabs in a greater or smaller amount by changing the '''Amount to Invoice''' as desired. The '''Amount to Invoice''' is added to the Accounts Receivable invoice when the pro forma invoice is released. 
*:On the '''Time and Material''' tab, if a manually edited '''Amount to Invoice''' is less than the '''Billed Amount''', you can make a decision about the difference between the calculated '''Billed Amount''' and the corrected '''Amount to Invoice''' by selecting the needed option in the '''Status''' column of the invoice line. The difference can be postponed until the next invoice (''Hold Remainder'') or written off by this invoice (''Write off Remainder''). The whole amount of the pro forma invoice line can also be written off (''Write off''); the amount will no longer show up in future invoices.
*:((({S:Hint}For a postponed amount to be added to a pro forma invoice, the Accounts Receivable invoice that contains the line from which this postponed amount originates must be released.
)))
*On the '''Time and Material''' tab, you can select a line and then click '''View Transactions Details''' on the table toolbar to drill down to the list of project transactions for which the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''' have been calculated by the formula of the billing rule. These values are summed to obtain the '''Billed Quantity''' and '''Billed Amount''', respectively, of the pro forma invoice line. You can remove particular transactions from this list, and they will appear in the next invoice.
*You can rearrange lines within the invoice by dragging them to the appropriate positions. If billing limit amounts are defined for the project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, the system applies these limit amounts to the pro forma invoice lines as a running total, starting from the first line on the '''Time and Material''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form. For each line of the invoice, the system subtracts the '''Amount to Invoice''' from the '''Max Available Amount''' and uses the reduced amount as the available limit for the next line. Invoice lines for which the '''Over Limit Amount''' becomes nonzero exceed the limit. By rearranging the lines, you can make the system apply the limit amounts to the needed lines of the invoice.
*You can add to a pro forma invoice an adjustment line that does not originate from the revenue budget or project transactions. Such lines are also included in the limit application and can decrease or increase the limit total.

==Releasing a Pro Forma Invoice==
The release of a pro forma invoice does not generate project transactions or General Ledger transactions directly. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates a corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice with all information copied from the pro forma invoice. You can release the pro forma invoices one by one on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, or you can mass-process pro forma invoices to release them and produce Accounts Receivable invoices on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_60_00|Process Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM506000|PM506000]) form.{br}

The pro forma invoices of a project can be released according to the following rules:[anchor|#ul_knj_rnp_1bb]
*The pro forma invoices can be released only one by one, starting from the earliest one, on the '''Invoices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The only exception is when multiple pro forma invoices segregated by invoice group have been generated during a single iteration of the billing process; in this case, the pro forma invoices can be released in any order.
*A pro forma invoice can be released only after the Accounts Receivable invoice of the preceding pro forma invoice has been released.

If the '''Detail Total''' of a pro forma invoice is negative on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form (for example, if you have added a negative adjustment line in an amount greater than the total amount of billable lines), the system creates an Accounts Receivable credit memo when the pro forma invoice is released.{br}

As a result of the release of the Accounts Receivable invoice, the General Ledger transactions are recorded, and the revenue budget of the corresponding project is changed as follows on '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form:[anchor|#ul_wcs_541_hbb]
*The '''Actual Quantity''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is increased by the line quantity of the released Accounts Receivable invoice if ''Task and Item'' is the '''Revenue Budget Level''' of the project; otherwise, the '''Actual Quantity''' is zero.
*The '''Actual Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is increased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice.
*The '''Draft Invoices Amount''' of the corresponding revenue budget line is decreased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice.

The document details of an unreleased Accounts Receivable document that originates from a pro forma invoice are displayed in read-only mode on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form. To make a correction to the Accounts Receivable document, you need to delete this document and start over from the pro forma invoice.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] form, you can also navigate directly to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] form by using the '''View Pro Forma''' menu command and view the pro forma invoice from which the current Accounts Receivable document originates. This menu command becomes available on the '''Inquiries''' menu if the invoice being viewed has originated from a pro forma invoice.

			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Pro Forma Invoices  Acumatica ERP provides draft (pro forma) invoice capabilities for project billing. A pro forma invoice,    which you can view on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, is isolated from    the Accounts Receivable module. You can review and modify the billable transactions and amounts    of the pro forma invoice before you prepare the Accounts Receivable invoice that is based on this    pro forma invoice. A pro forma invoice can be printed and sent to a customer as many times as is    necessary until an agreement is reached. Once all the necessary changes have been applied to the pro forma invoice, it can be approved    and released. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates an Accounts Receivable    invoice with all the information copied from the pro forma invoice. With this process, you    minimize corrections in the Accounts Receivable module. Pro forma invoices provide the following capabilities: On the  Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects     (PM301000) form, you can define billing limit amounts for revenue budget lines of the project     if the  Use T&M Revenue Budget Limits  check box is selected on the       Summary  tab of this form. The system applies these limit amounts to the     pro forma invoices of the project. If an invoice exceeds a limit, on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form, the user receives a warning or an error message, depending on     the  Validate T&M Revenue Budget Limits  setting on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. You can configure an approval workflow for pro forma invoices that includes a sequence of     approval steps based on a comprehensive approval map specified in the  Pro Forma      Approval Map  box on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences form. You can use different formats of printable pro forma invoices, depending on the particular     project. On the  Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, you can specify a custom format and an email notification template that should be used     for the printing and emailing of the pro forma invoices prepared for that project. Also, in      the  Bill-to Contact  and  Bill-to Address  sections      of the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, you can      specify the contact information of the customer to whom the pro forma invoices should be sent.      This information is copied to each pro forma invoice created for the project and can be      modified at the invoice level. Creating a Pro Forma Invoice A pro forma invoice can be created only through the project billing process (and assigned a     reference number only automatically). You cannot manually enter new pro forma invoices on the        ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form. By default, the system creates a pro forma     invoice when you bill a project because the  Create Pro Forma on Billing      check box is initially selected on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. To disable the draft invoice workflow for a     project, you can clear this check box—that is, to prevent the system from creating a pro forma     invoice when you bill the project. For a pro forma invoice created for a project, the system records to the following tabs of the        ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form the lines to be billed: Progress Billing : The system creates these lines by using the        Progress Billing  steps of billing rules specified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form. The lines originate from the revenue budget of the project. Time and Material  The system creates these lines by using the  Time       and Material  steps of billing rules; the lines originate from the project       transactions. The  Time and Material  steps of billing rules support the aggregation of       project transactions by date, employee, vendor, and inventory item. On the  Time and        Material  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form, you can select a line       and then click  View Transactions Details  on the table toolbar to drill       down to the list of project transactions based on which the  Billed        Quantity  and  Billed Amount  of the line have been       calculated by the formula of the billing rule. Fore more information about the billing process, see  Project Billing. Modifying a Pro Forma Invoice On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, you can edit a pro forma invoice     when it is  On Hold , including the following: You can delete a line of the pro forma invoice to bill it later in the full amount. You can modify the pro forma invoice to bill any lines on the  Progress       Billing  and  Time and Material  tabs in a greater or smaller      amount by changing the  Amount to Invoice  as desired. The        Amount to Invoice  is added to the Accounts Receivable invoice when the      pro forma invoice is released.  On the  Time and Material  tab, if a       manually edited  Amount to Invoice  is less than the  Billed        Amount , you can make a decision about the difference between the calculated         Billed Amount  and the corrected  Amount to        Invoice  by selecting the needed option in the  Status        column of the invoice line. The difference can be postponed until the next invoice ( Hold        Remainder ) or written off by this invoice ( Write off Remainder ). The whole amount       of the pro forma invoice line can also be written off ( Write off ); the amount will no       longer show up in future invoices. For a postponed amount to be added to a pro forma       invoice, the Accounts Receivable invoice that contains the line from which this postponed       amount originates must be released. On the  Time and Material  tab, you can select a line and then click        View Transactions Details  on the table toolbar to drill down to the      list of project transactions for which the  Billed Quantity  and        Billed Amount  have been calculated by the formula of the billing rule.      These values are summed to obtain the  Billed Quantity  and        Billed Amount , respectively, of the pro forma invoice line. You can      remove particular transactions from this list, and they will appear in the next invoice. You can rearrange lines within the invoice by dragging them to the appropriate positions. If      billing limit amounts are defined for the project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects      (PM301000) form, the system applies these limit amounts to the pro forma invoice lines as a      running total, starting from the first line on the  Time and Material  tab      of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form. For each line of the invoice, the system subtracts      the  Amount to Invoice  from the  Max Available       Amount  and uses the reduced amount as the available limit for the next line.      Invoice lines for which the  Over Limit Amount  becomes nonzero exceed the      limit. By rearranging the lines, you can make the system apply the limit amounts to the needed      lines of the invoice. You can add to a pro forma invoice an adjustment line that does not originate from the      revenue budget or project transactions. Such lines are also included in the limit application      and can decrease or increase the limit total. Releasing a Pro Forma Invoice The release of a pro forma invoice does not generate project transactions or General Ledger     transactions directly. When you release the pro forma invoice, the system creates a     corresponding Accounts Receivable invoice with all information copied from the pro forma     invoice. You can release the pro forma invoices one by one on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices (PM307000) form, or you can mass-process pro forma invoices to release them and produce     Accounts Receivable invoices on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM506000|PM506000]) Process Pro Forma Invoices (PM506000) form. The pro forma invoices of a project can be released according to the following rules: The pro forma invoices can be released only one by one, starting from the earliest one, on      the  Invoices  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000)      form. The only exception is when multiple pro forma invoices segregated by invoice group have      been generated during a single iteration of the billing process; in this case, the pro forma      invoices can be released in any order. A pro forma invoice can be released only after the Accounts Receivable invoice of the      preceding pro forma invoice has been released. If the  Detail Total  of a pro forma invoice is negative on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form (for example, if you have added a negative adjustment line in an     amount greater than the total amount of billable lines), the system creates an Accounts     Receivable credit memo when the pro forma invoice is released. As a result of the release of the Accounts Receivable invoice, the General Ledger transactions     are recorded, and the revenue budget of the corresponding project is changed as follows on       Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form: The  Actual Quantity  of the corresponding revenue budget line is      increased by the line quantity of the released Accounts Receivable invoice if  Task and       Item  is the  Revenue Budget Level  of the project; otherwise, the        Actual Quantity  is zero. The  Actual Amount  of the corresponding revenue budget line is      increased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice. The  Draft Invoices Amount  of the corresponding revenue budget line is      decreased by the line amount of the released Accounts Receivable invoice. The document details of an unreleased Accounts Receivable document that originates from a pro     forma invoice are displayed in read-only mode on the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos     (AR301000) form. To make a correction to the Accounts Receivable document, you need to delete     this document and start over from the pro forma invoice. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) Invoices and Memos form, you can also navigate directly to the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) Pro Forma Invoices form by using the  View Pro Forma  menu command and view the pro     forma invoice from which the current Accounts Receivable document originates. This menu command     becomes available on the  Inquiries  menu if the invoice being viewed has     originated from a pro forma invoice. ]]></column>

For individual projects, you can configure different formats for printable pro forma invoices and Accounts Receivable invoices. The invoice format may depend on the project type; for instance, an installation project may have one invoice format, and a repair project may have a different invoice format. Also, a default invoice format can be specified for particular customers, with this format used for all projects of this customer unless the user specifies a different format. For example, a company might use a particular invoice format for government customers, or for customers who work with a particular bank to get loans for their projects (and this bank dictates the invoice format).{br}{TOC}
==Defining Printing Forms of Invoices for Projects==
On the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can specify a custom format and an email notification template that should be used for the printing and emailing of the invoices prepared for the particular project. When you create a new project, the system copies all the predefined mailing settings from the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, but you can override them. You can use the following predefined mailings:[anchor|#ul_odx_jys_qbb]
*''PROFORMA'': The mailing with this identifier is used to print pro forma invoices. By default, this mailing uses the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_64_20_00|Pro Forma Invoice] ([~/?ScreenId=PM642000|PM642000]) report for printing the pro forma invoice.
*''INVOICE'': The mailing with this identifier is used to print Accounts Receivable invoices that originate from the Projects module. By default, this mailing uses the ProInvoice/Memo (PM641000) report, which is a copy of the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_64_10_00|Invoice/Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) report, for printing the invoice.

If you need to override the printing form of pro forma invoices or Accounts Receivable invoices for a project, you edit the respective mailing setting but do not edit the mailing identifier, which is the system setting. For example, suppose you need to override the printing form of pro forma invoices for a project. For the ''PROFORMA'' mailing of this project, you select the needed report from the Projects module in the '''Report''' column of the '''Mailing''' table on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
==Printing Invoices==
When you print a pro forma invoice on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_70_00|Pro Forma Invoices] ([~/?ScreenId=PM307000|PM307000]) form, the system uses the report specified for the ''PROFORMA'' mailing of the corresponding project on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the corresponding project has no mailing setting with the ''PROFORMA'' identifier, an error occurs.{br}

When you print an Accounts Receivable invoice that originates from the Projects module on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_10_00|Invoices and Memos] ([~/?ScreenId=AR301000|AR301000]) form, the system uses one of the following reports:[anchor|#ul_sd3_krt_qbb]
*The report specified for the ''INVOICE'' mailing, if one is specified, of the corresponding project on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
*The report specified for the customer on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form if the ''INVOICE'' mailing of the corresponding project is not active. For more information about mailing settings for customers, see [HelpRoot_Financials\AR__con_Predefined_Mailings_for_Customers_and_Vendors|Mailings for Customers].
*The [HelpRoot_ReportReference\AR_64_10_00|Invoice/Memo] ([~/?ScreenId=AR641000|AR641000]) report if the ''INVOICE'' mailing of the corresponding project and the customer is not active.

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
A cost code represents an additional classification level for project revenues and costs, as a subaccount does in the General Ledger module. You can associate cost codes with different documents and document lines across the system where projects can be referenced, such as General Ledger transactions, Accounts Payable bills, purchase orders, Accounts Receivable invoices, expense entries, time cards, and lines of project budgets.{br}

The functionality of cost codes is available only if the ''Cost Codes'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. This feature can be used only with the Construction Edition.
==Cost Code Identifier==
The identifiers of cost codes have a segmented structure, which can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_20_00|Segmented Keys] ([~/?ScreenId=CS202000|CS202000]) form for the ''COSTCODE'' segmented key. By default, ''COSTCODE'' is a one-segment key that consists of four numeric symbols. For details on changing the structure of a segmented key, see [HelpRoot_Administration\CS__con_Identifier_Segmentation|Segmented Identifiers].{br}

You can change the value of a cost code identifier by selecting the cost code on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_95_00|Cost Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209500|PM209500]) form and clicking '''Change ID''' on the form toolbar.
==System Cost Code==
Starting 2019 R1 the system cost code is present by default, even if the ''Cost Codes'' feature is not enabled. The system cost code has the ''0000'' identifier and the ''DEFAULT'' description. The system does this to preserve data consistency, because the system cost code is one of the components of the compound key in the <tt>PMBudget</tt> table in the database. When the ''Cost Codes'' feature is enabled and the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_95_00|Cost Codes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209500|PM209500]) form becomes available, a user can change this cost code and its description but cannot delete it.
==Cost Code Lookup Table==
When you create a document or a document line that you want to associate with a cost code, you first specify a GL account, a project, and a project task for the record. When you click the selector button for a '''Cost Code''' element to assign a cost code to this document or document line, the system opens a lookup table that has the following tabs:[anchor|#_8048b50d-e49b-4f3f-8ad4-6e92b49ff5ee]
*'''All Records''': The tab lists all the cost codes defined in the system.
*'''Project Codes''': The tab, which is opened by default, lists the cost codes that are filtered as follows: The system looks for the cost codes used in budget lines of the project selected for the document or document line, and it then looks for the budget lines that have the same project task and the account group, which corresponds to the GL account selected for the document or document line. The cost code description that is displayed in the '''Project Codes''' filter tab of the lookup table is retrieved from the found project budget line. The list is empty if there are no cost codes already used for the combination of project, project task, and GL account specified for the document or document line. In this case, switch to the '''All Records''' tab, and select the needed cost code.
((({S:Hint}If you select a cost code that has not yet been used for the combination of project, project task, and account, the system will warn you about this.
)))
==Project Budget with Cost Codes==
You can define the revenue budget of a project at the task and cost code detail level by selecting for a project the ''Task and Cost Code'' option in the '''Revenue Budget Level''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. {br}

When this option is selected, you can view revenue budget lines by cost codes on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form for the project. You can change a cost code for each line manually, if needed.{br}

Similarly, you can view and change cost codes for each cost budget line on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form for the project.
==Project Billing by Task and Cost Codes==
Progress billing by task and cost code is available for projects with the ''Task and Cost Code'' revenue budget level specified on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. Time and material billing by task and cost code is available for a project with any revenue budget level. Both types of billing (progress and time and material) work similarly to billing by task and inventory item. For details, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Billing_Procedure|Project Billing].

By         default,  COSTCODE  is a one-segment key that consists of four numeric symbols. For         details on changing the structure of a segmented key, see  Segmented Identifiers. You can change the value of a cost code identifier by selecting the cost code on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209500|PM209500]) Cost Codes (PM209500) form and clicking  Change ID          on the form toolbar. System Cost Code Starting  2019 R1 the system cost code is present by default, even if the  Cost Codes  feature is not         enabled. The system cost code has the  0000  identifier and the  DEFAULT          description. The system does this to preserve data consistency, because the system cost code         is one of the components of the compound key in the  PMBudget  table in the database.         When the  Cost Codes  feature is enabled and the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM209500|PM209500]) Cost Codes         (PM209500) form becomes available, a user can change this cost code and its description         but cannot delete it. Cost Code Lookup Table When you create a document or a document line that you want to associate with a cost code,         you first specify a GL account, a project, and a project task for the record. When you click         the selector button for a  Cost Code  element to assign a cost code to         this document or document line, the system opens a lookup table that has the following         tabs: All Records : The tab lists all the cost codes defined in the           system. Project Codes : The tab, which is opened by default, lists the           cost codes that are filtered as follows: The system looks for the cost codes used in           budget lines of the project selected for the document or document line, and it then looks           for the budget lines that have the same project task and the account group, which           corresponds to the GL account selected for the document or document line. The cost code           description that is displayed in the  Project Codes  filter tab of           the lookup table is retrieved from the found project budget line. The list is empty if           there are no cost codes already used for the combination of project, project task, and GL           account specified for the document or document line. In this case, switch to the              All Records  tab, and select the needed cost code. If you select a cost code that has not yet been used for the combination of project,         project task, and account, the system will warn you about this. Project Budget with Cost Codes You can define the revenue budget of a project at the task and cost code detail level by         selecting for a project the  Task and Cost Code  option in the  Revenue           Budget Level  box on the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form.  When this option is selected, you can view revenue budget lines by cost codes on the            Revenue Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form for         the project. You can change a cost code for each line manually, if needed. Similarly, you can view and change cost codes for each cost budget line on the  Cost           Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form for the project. Project Billing by Task and Cost Codes Progress billing by task and cost code is available for projects with the  Task and Cost           Code  revenue budget level specified on the  Summary  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. Time and material billing by task and         cost code is available for a project with any revenue budget level. Both types of billing         (progress and time and material) work similarly to billing by task and inventory item. For         details, see  Project Billing.  ([~/?ScreenId=PM209500|PM209500]) ]]></column>

			<column name="Content"><![CDATA[
 Acumatica ERP provides change order functionality, which you can use to control changes to project&rsquo;s budgeted and committed values and control the profitability of every change initiated by a customer. A change order is a document for profitability analysis and an audit trial of changes to the project revenue budget, commitments, and budgeted costs. Change orders do not alter the original figures of a project directly; they are tracked separately from the original figures for analysis.{br}

Change orders provide the following functionality:[anchor|#_7c070315-7a83-4386-87e0-699526baa0d0]
*The ability to record changes to the project revenue budget, cost budgets, and commitments.
*The ability to review the list of change orders related to a project on the '''Change Orders''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.
*The ability to see on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form the changes for each purchase order as well as the original and committed values.
*The ability to see on the '''Change Orders''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form the list of change orders that affect the purchase order.
*The ability to see the profitability of every change of the project budget initiated by the customer.

The functionality of change orders is available only if the ''Change Orders'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.[anchor|#section_i3l_d4p_mcb]
==Projects with the Change Order Workflow==
To enable the change order workflow for a project, which enables the creation of change orders, you should select the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and save changes to the project.{br}

If the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check boxes is selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form, and a project has related purchase orders, you can enable the change order workflow for the project if there are no open related purchase order lines. That is, the status of related purchase order lines of the project is only ''Completed'', ''Closed'', or ''Canceled''.[anchor|#section_nm5_q4p_mcb]
==Project Budget Freeze==
During the initial stage of a project, after the project budget has been agreed upon, you can lock the original figures from further editing by using the '''Lock Budget''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. After the original values are locked, you can update the revised budget figures in the following ways:[anchor|#_0f87a112-f7d5-449b-bb02-9ddc7c69efaa]
*If the project does not use the change order workflow, the revised budget figures can be edited manually on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
*:The following columns of the project with the locked budget are read-only on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form: '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', '''Unit Rate''', and '''Original Budgeted Amount'''.
*With the change order workflow enabled for the project, the revised budget figures become read-only, and all changes to the project budget can be made only with change orders. The system updates the revised budget figures based on change orders as follows: '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' = '''Original Budgeted Amount''' + The amount of the released change orders.
*:The following columns of the project with the locked budget are read-only on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form: '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', '''Unit Rate''', '''Original Budgeted Amount''', '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''', and '''Revised Budgeted Amount'''.

The '''Lock Budget''' action on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form applies to both the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. The '''Unlock Budget''' action makes the original budget figures available for editing even if the change order workflow has been enabled for the project.[anchor|#section_pbd_zbq_mcb]
==Change Order Creation==
A new change order can be created either directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form or on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, if you click '''Create Change Order''' on the form toolbar or click '''Create Change Order''' on the table toolbar of the '''Change Orders''' tab.{br}

In a change order with the ''On Hold'' status, you can enter the necessary amendments to the project budget and commitments. On the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form, when you edit a change order line, you can see the original budgeted amount in the '''Original Budgeted Amount''' column; the released and draft change order amounts in the '''Previously Approved CO Amount''' and '''Other Draft CO Amount''' columns, respectively; and the revised budgeted amount in the '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' column. You can do any of the following on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form:[anchor|#_1ed4c058-fc8b-4546-8970-953569aa8338]
*On the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs:
**Create a new budget line with a positive amount
**Create a new budget line with a negative amount
**Add an existing budget line
**Make a deduction from an existing budget line
**:((({S:Hint}You can add an existing budget line to be modified to the change order in the '''Select Budget Lines''' dialog box if you click '''Select Budget Lines''' on the table toolbar.
)))
*On the '''Commitments''' tab:
**Create a new purchase order with a new line
**Add a new line to an existing purchase order
**Add to an existing purchase order line
**Make a deduction from an existing purchase order line
**:((({S:Hint}[anchor|#ul_ums_3vl_zcb]
*You can add an existing commitment to be modified to the change order in the '''Select Commitments''' dialog box if you click '''Select Commitments''' on the table toolbar.
*The deduction from the amount and quantity of a purchase order line can be no greater than the '''Received Qty.''' and '''Received Amount''' of the line.
)))

A change order document has the following reference numbers in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form:[anchor|#_7ad7e8ee-88e8-4a5e-b504-c6b7d3069bfe]
*'''Reference Nbr.''': The number of the change order in the system. This number is assigned to each change order based on the ''CHANGEORD'' numbering sequence, which is selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form and can be reviewed or modified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_10_10|Numbering Sequences] ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) form.
*'''Revenue Change Nbr.''': The number of the change order that can affect the revenue within the applicable project. Each project has its own numbering sequence of such change orders. The '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' is an integer that the system assigns sequentially: 0001 for the first change order for the project, 0002 for the second, 0003 for the third, and so on. The last assigned number for the project is shown in the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' box in the '''Project Properties''' area of the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.
*:You can manually change the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of particular change order. (Duplicate numbers within a project are not allowed, however.) If you change the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a change order, you should respectively change the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' of the corresponding project so that the system continues to assign these numbers correctly.
*:For the changes orders that cannot affect the project revenue and the ''Reversing'' change orders, the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' is read-only and equal to ''N/A''.
*:For the ''Reversed'' change orders, you can reuse the '''Revenue Change Nbr.'''—that is, assign the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a ''Reversed'' change order to a new change order. This will not lead to an error of duplicated numbers because the ''Reversed'' change order does not affect the project revenue anymore. If you reuse the '''Revenue Change Nbr.''' of a ''Reversed'' change order, you should respectively change the '''Last Revenue Change Nbr.''' of the corresponding project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form so that the system continues to assign these numbers correctly.
*'''External Reference Nbr.''': The external reference number. This number, which is entered manually, can be the identifier required by the customer or the number from an external system integrated with Acumatica ERP.

A change order can also have a detailed description, which you can enter on the '''Detailed Description''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form.[anchor|#section_xv2_f1w_mcb]
==Change Order Approval==
The change order supports the standard Acumatica ERP approval process.{br}

The approval map can be configured on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_20_55_00|Assignment and Approval Maps] ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) form and then specified in the '''Change Order Approval Map''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form along with the default pending change order approval notification in the '''Pending Change Order Approval Notification''' box on the same form.{br}

The approval process is optional; the configuration of the approval process can be skipped and you can create an approved change order right away.[anchor|#section_vgz_15w_mcb]
==Change Order Printing==
You can print a change order with any status. For the printing of change orders, the system uses the form that is specified on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. By default, this is the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_64_30_00|Change Order] ([~/?ScreenId=PM643000|PM643000]) report. This report supports the printing of revenue budget lines, header-level and line-level notes, and the detailed description of a change order.{br}

You can override the default printed form by defining a project-specific report on the '''Mailing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. For a project, you can specify the custom print form and email notification template that should be used for printing and emailing of change orders prepared for the project. On the '''Billing Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, you can also specify the contact information of the customer to whom change orders prepared for the project should be sent.[anchor|#section_py4_wtw_mcb]
==Change Order Release==
When a change order is released, the balances and commitments of the corresponding project are updated as follows:[anchor|#_025830d7-ba7d-4735-9884-1ddf203522b7]
*If the project has a revenue budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory item, and account group as a revenue budget line of the change order, the system updates the following columns of the revenue budget line of the project on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form:
**'''Budgeted CO Quantity''' = The total quantity of released change orders
**'''Budgeted CO Amount''' = The total amount of released change orders
**'''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' = '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' + '''Budgeted CO Quantity'''
** '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' = '''Original Budgeted Amount''' + '''Budgeted CO Amount'''
** '''Pending Invoice Amount''' = '''Completed (%)''' &#42; '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' – '''Actual Amount''' – '''Draft Invoices Amount'''
**:((({S:Hint}As the result of the update, this amount can take rational values, including negative ones.
)))
*If the project does not have a revenue budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory item, and account group as a revenue budget line of the change order, the system creates a new revenue budget line for the project based on the revenue budget line of the change order.
*If the project has a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory item, and account group as a cost budget line of the change order, the system updates the following columns of the cost budget line of the project on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form:
**'''Budgeted CO Quantity''' = The total quantity of released change orders
**'''Budgeted CO Amount''' = The total amount of released change orders
**'''Revised Budgeted Quantity''' = '''Original Budgeted Quantity''' + '''Budgeted CO Quantity'''
** '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' = '''Original Budgeted Amount''' + '''Budgeted CO Amount'''
*If the project does not have a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory item, and account group as a cost budget line of the change order, the system creates a new cost budget line for the project based on the cost budget line of the change order.
*If a commitment line of the change order has the ''Update'' or ''Reopen'' status, the system updates the following values of the corresponding purchase order line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form based on the commitment line of the change order:
**'''Order Qty.''' = Original '''Order Qty.''' of the purchase order line + '''Quantity''' of the commitment line of the change order
**'''Open Quantity''' = '''Order Qty.''' – '''Qty. on Receipts'''
** '''Ext. Cost''' = Original '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line + '''Amount''' of the commitment line of the change order
**'''Open Amount''' = '''Ext. Cost''' – '''Received Amount'''
** '''Requested Date''' = '''Order Date''' of the commitment line of the change order
**'''Completed''', '''Canceled''', and '''Closed''' check boxes are cleared
*If a commitment line of the change order has the ''New Line'' status, the system adds a new line with the following values to the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form for the corresponding purchase order based on the commitment line of the change order:
**'''Order Qty.''' = '''Quantity''' of the commitment line of the change order
**'''Ext. Cost''' = '''Amount''' of the commitment line of the change order
**'''Requested Date''' = '''Order Date''' of the commitment line of the change order
*If any commitment lines of the change order have the ''New Document'' status, the system groups these lines by vendor and creates a new purchase order on [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] form for each vendor based on the commitment lines of the change order as follows:
**The date of the created purchase order is the earliest '''Order Date''' of the commitment lines of the change order.
**The '''Requested Date''' of each purchase order line is the '''Order Date''' of the commitment line of the change order.
**The system generates the default description of the created purchase order by using the following formula: {{'''Description''' = 'Change Order #' + [PMChangeOrder.RefNbr]}}.
*:((({S:Hint}A purchase order that originates from a change order cannot be edited or removed and can be only canceled, completed, or altered by yet another change order.
)))
*For each purchase order line updated by a change order, the system updates the corresponding project commitment on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form. For each purchase order line created from a change order, the system creates a new project commitment. In these commitments, the values are updated as follows:
**'''Revised Committed Quantity''' = '''Order Qty.''' of the purchase order line
**'''Revised Committed Amount''' = '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line
**'''Committed CO Quantity''' = '''Revised Committed Quantity''' – '''Original Committed Quantity'''
** '''Committed CO Amount''' = '''Revised Committed Amount''' – '''Original Committed Amount'''
** '''Committed Open Amount''' = '''Open Amount''' of the purchase order line
*:If the project has a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory item, and account group as an updated or newly created commitment, the system updates the cost budget line of the project on the '''Cost Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Otherwise, the system creates a new cost budget line for the project based on the commitment.
[anchor|#section_zlm_f3x_mcb]
==Change Order Reversal==
After a change order has been released, it can no longer be changed and can only be reversed on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form if you click '''Reverse''' action on the form toolbar. When the change order is reversed, the system creates a new change order with lines that reverse the impact of the original change order. In this reversing change order, the quantity and amount of a commitment line cannot be greater than the '''Received Qty.''' and '''Received Amount''' of the corresponding purchase order line on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. A commitment line of this reversing change order also cannot reduce the '''Order Qty.''' of a purchase order line to zero. You may cancel the purchase order line in this case.[anchor|#section_qkr_hkx_mcb]
==Change Order Classes==
Change order classes, which you can create on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_30_00|Change Order Classes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) form, make it possible to group change orders by their impact on projects and by additional attributes that classes can have. You can also segregate changes by class in reports to analyze, for example, which types of changes have the greatest impact on project profitability. For instance, by using a change order class, you can create an internal change order that does not affect the revenue budget of projects and is not assigned any reference number within a project. This class of change orders will not have the '''Revenue Budget''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form.{br}

Change order classes also support the use of global attributes defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_20_50_00|Attributes] ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) form. A list of attributes can be specified for a change order class to be available in each change order belonging to the class.{br}

You can specify a default change order class in the '''Default Change Order Class''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form. The default change order class is then assigned to each newly created document on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] form.[anchor|#section_pg4_ylx_mcb]
==Purchase Order Workflow with Change Orders==
Change orders can be created for the ''Normal'' type of purchase orders. The change order workflow affects the standard purchase order life cycle as follows:[anchor|#_83759acb-5a92-49e2-8d05-f1e2502876e2]
*If a normal purchase order has at least one line refers to a project with the change order workflow enabled and the purchase order has no related change orders, the purchase order can be modified directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form. At the same time, you can create a change order for such purchase order, if needed.
*The change order workflow is automatically enabled for a normal purchase order with at least one line refers to a project with the change order workflow enabled if at least one change order has been created for the purchase order.
*After the change order workflow has been enabled for a purchase order, the purchase order cannot be removed or put on hold.
*After an existing purchase order with the ''Open'' status has been changed by means of a change order and printing or emailing is required for the purchase order, the system assigns to the purchase order the ''Pending Printing'' or ''Pending Email'' status, respectively.
*A purchase order with the ''Pending Printing'' or ''Pending Email'' status cannot be removed from the system if there is a change order that refers to this purchase order.
*A purchase order with the ''Open'' status and with the change order workflow enabled can be modified by means of change orders only.
*A purchase order with the ''Open'' status and with the change order workflow enabled or an open line of this purchase order can be canceled or completed.
*A purchase order with the ''Completed'', ''Closed'', or ''Canceled'' status can be reopened by means of change orders. Such an order will be assigned the ''Open'', ''Pending Printing'', or ''Pending Email'' status depending on the purchase order workflow.
*A purchase order that originates from a change order cannot be edited or removed and can be only printed, emailed, canceled, completed, or altered by yet another change order.
[anchor|#section_dc1_3qx_mcb]
==Ability to Control the Original Committed Values==
At the initial stage of a project, after the original commitments have been agreed on with vendors and entered into the system, you can lock the commitments for the project, after which all further amendments to the committed figures should be tracked as project changes by change orders. The following commands in the '''Actions''' menu become available on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form when the ''Change Orders'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] form and the '''Internal Cost Commitment Tracking''' check boxes is selected on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_10_10_00|Projects Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) form:{br}

This action appears on the form if .[anchor|#_2d5a13bf-1ecd-4ecd-9d12-881f5090d75b]
*'''Lock Commitments''': When this action is applied for a project, purchase orders for this project cannot be created directly on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form, existing purchase orders cannot be put on hold, and the commitments of the project can be modified by means of change orders only.
*'''Unlock Commitments''': This action gives users the ability to directly enter purchase orders for the project.

The ability to see on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form the changes for         each purchase order as well as the original and committed values. The ability to see on the  Change Orders  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form the list of change orders that affect the         purchase order. The ability to see the profitability of every change of the project budget initiated by the     customer. The functionality of change orders is available only if the  Change Orders  feature is    enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features (CS100000) form. Projects with the Change Order Workflow To enable the change order workflow for a project, which enables the creation of change         orders, you should select the  Change Order Workflow  check box on the            Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form         and save changes to the project. If the  Internal Cost Commitment Tracking  check boxes is selected on         the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences         (PM101000) form, and a project has related purchase orders, you can enable the change order         workflow for the project if there are no open related purchase order lines. That is, the         status of related purchase order lines of the project is only  Completed ,            Closed , or  Canceled . Project Budget Freeze During the initial stage of a project, after the project budget has been agreed upon, you can         lock the original figures from further editing by using the  Lock           Budget  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. After         the original values are locked, you can update the revised budget figures in the following         ways: If the project does not use the change order workflow, the revised budget figures can be           edited manually on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. The following columns of             the project with the locked budget are read-only on the  Revenue               Budget  and  Cost Budget  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form:  Original Budgeted Quantity ,                Unit Rate , and  Original Budgeted             Amount . With the change order workflow enabled for the project, the revised budget figures become           read-only, and all changes to the project budget can be made only with change orders. The           system updates the revised budget figures based on change orders as follows:              Revised Budgeted Amount  =  Original Budgeted             Amount  + The amount of the released change orders. The following columns             of the project with the locked budget are read-only on the  Revenue               Budget  and  Cost Budget  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form:  Original Budgeted Quantity ,                Unit Rate ,  Original Budgeted Amount ,                Revised Budgeted Quantity , and  Revised Budgeted               Amount . The  Lock Budget  action on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form     applies to both the  Revenue Budget  and  Cost Budget      tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. The  Unlock Budget      action makes the original budget figures available for editing even if the change order workflow     has been enabled for the project. Change Order Creation A new change order can be created either directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders         (PM308000) form or on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form, if you click            Create Change Order  on the form toolbar or click  Create           Change Order  on the table toolbar of the  Change Orders          tab. In a change order with the  On Hold  status, you can enter the necessary amendments to         the project budget and commitments. On the  Revenue Budget  and            Cost Budget  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders form, when         you edit a change order line, you can see the original budgeted amount in the            Original Budgeted Amount  column; the released and draft change         order amounts in the  Previously Approved CO Amount  and            Other Draft CO Amount  columns, respectively; and the revised         budgeted amount in the  Revised Budgeted Amount  column. You can do any         of the following on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders form: On the  Revenue Budget  and  Cost Budget  tabs: Create a new budget line with a positive amount Create a new budget line with a negative amount Add an existing budget line Make a deduction from an existing budget line You can add an existing budget                 line to be modified to the change order in the  Select Budget                   Lines  dialog box if you click  Select Budget                   Lines  on the table toolbar. On the  Commitments  tab: Create a new purchase order with a new line Add a new line to an existing purchase order Add to an existing purchase order line Make a deduction from an existing purchase order line You can add an existing commitment to be modified to the change order in the                        Select Commitments  dialog box if you click                        Select Commitments  on the table toolbar. The deduction from the amount and quantity of a purchase order line can be no                     greater than the  Received Qty.  and  Received                       Amount  of the line. A change order document has the following reference numbers in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders form: Reference Nbr. : The number of the change order in the system. This           number is assigned to each change order based on the  CHANGEORD  numbering sequence,           which is selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form and can be           reviewed or modified on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS201010|CS201010]) Numbering Sequences (CS201010) form. Revenue Change Nbr. : The number of the change order that can affect           the revenue within the applicable project. Each project has its own numbering sequence of           such change orders. The  Revenue Change Nbr.  is an integer that the           system assigns sequentially: 0001 for the first change order for the project, 0002 for the           second, 0003 for the third, and so on. The last assigned number for the project is shown           in the  Last Revenue Change Nbr.  box in the  Project             Properties  area of the  Summary  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. You can manually change the  Revenue Change               Nbr.  of particular change order. (Duplicate numbers within a project are             not allowed, however.) If you change the  Revenue Change Nbr.  of a             change order, you should respectively change the  Last Revenue Change               Nbr.  of the corresponding project so that the system continues to assign             these numbers correctly. For the changes orders that cannot affect the project             revenue and the  Reversing  change orders, the  Revenue Change               Nbr.  is read-only and equal to  N/A . For the  Reversed              change orders, you can reuse the  Revenue Change Nbr. —that is,             assign the  Revenue Change Nbr.  of a  Reversed  change order             to a new change order. This will not lead to an error of duplicated numbers because the                Reversed  change order does not affect the project revenue anymore. If you reuse             the  Revenue Change Nbr.  of a  Reversed  change order, you             should respectively change the  Last Revenue Change Nbr.  of the             corresponding project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form so that the system             continues to assign these numbers correctly. External Reference Nbr. : The external reference number. This number,           which is entered manually, can be the identifier required by the customer or the number           from an external system integrated with  Acumatica ERP. A change order can also have a detailed description, which you can enter on the            Detailed Description  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders         form. Change Order Approval The change order supports the standard  Acumatica ERP approval process. The approval map can be configured on the   ([~/?ScreenId=EP205500|EP205500]) Assignment and Approval Maps (EP205500) form         and then specified in the  Change Order Approval Map  box on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences         (PM101000) form along with the default pending change order approval notification in the            Pending Change Order Approval Notification  box on the same         form. The approval process is optional; the configuration of the approval process can be skipped and         you can create an approved change order right away. Change Order Printing You can print a change order with any status. For the printing of change orders, the system         uses the form that is specified on the  Mailing Settings  tab of the             ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. By default, this is the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM643000|PM643000]) Change Order (PM643000) report. This report supports the printing of         revenue budget lines, header-level and line-level notes, and the detailed description of a         change order. You can override the default printed form by defining a project-specific report on the            Mailing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. For a project, you can specify the custom print form and email         notification template that should be used for printing and emailing of change orders         prepared for the project. On the  Billing Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, you can also specify the contact information of the         customer to whom change orders prepared for the project should be sent. Change Order Release When a change order is released, the balances and commitments of the corresponding project are     updated as follows: If the project has a revenue budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory           item, and account group as a revenue budget line of the change order, the system updates           the following columns of the revenue budget line of the project on the  Revenue             Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form: Budgeted CO Quantity  = The total quantity of released change               orders Budgeted CO Amount  = The total amount of released change               orders Revised Budgeted Quantity  =  Original Budgeted                 Quantity  +  Budgeted CO Quantity Revised Budgeted Amount  =  Original Budgeted                 Amount  +  Budgeted CO Amount Pending Invoice Amount  =  Completed (%)                *  Revised Budgeted Amount  –  Actual                 Amount  –  Draft Invoices Amount As the                 result of the update, this amount can take rational values, including negative                 ones. If the project does not have a revenue budget line with the same project task, cost code or      inventory item, and account group as a revenue budget line of the change order, the system      creates a new revenue budget line for the project based on the revenue budget line of the      change order. If the project has a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or inventory           item, and account group as a cost budget line of the change order, the system updates the           following columns of the cost budget line of the project on the  Cost             Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form: Budgeted CO Quantity  = The total quantity of released change               orders Budgeted CO Amount  = The total amount of released change               orders Revised Budgeted Quantity  =  Original Budgeted                 Quantity  +  Budgeted CO Quantity Revised Budgeted Amount  =  Original Budgeted                 Amount  +  Budgeted CO Amount If the project does not have a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or      inventory item, and account group as a cost budget line of the change order, the system creates      a new cost budget line for the project based on the cost budget line of the change order. If a commitment line of the change order has the  Update  or  Reopen  status, the           system updates the following values of the corresponding purchase order line on the              Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders           (PO301000) form based on the commitment line of the change order: Order Qty.  = Original  Order Qty.  of               the purchase order line +  Quantity  of the commitment line of               the change order Open Quantity  =  Order Qty.  –                  Qty. on Receipts Ext. Cost  = Original  Ext. Cost  of the               purchase order line +  Amount  of the commitment line of the               change order Open Amount  =  Ext. Cost  –                  Received Amount Requested Date  =  Order Date  of the               commitment line of the change order Completed ,  Canceled , and                  Closed  check boxes are cleared If a commitment line of the change order has the  New Line  status, the system adds a           new line with the following values to the  Document Details  tab of           the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form for the corresponding purchase order based on the           commitment line of the change order: Order Qty.  =  Quantity  of the               commitment line of the change order Ext. Cost  =  Amount  of the commitment               line of the change order Requested Date  =  Order Date  of the               commitment line of the change order If any commitment lines of the change order have the  New Document  status, the system           groups these lines by vendor and creates a new purchase order on   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders form for each vendor based on the commitment lines of the           change order as follows: The date of the created purchase order is the earliest  Order                 Date  of the commitment lines of the change order. The  Requested Date  of each purchase order line is the                  Order Date  of the commitment line of the change order. The system generates the default description of the created purchase order by using               the following formula:  Description  = 'Change Order #' +                 [PMChangeOrder.RefNbr] . A purchase order that originates from a change order cannot be edited or             removed and can be only canceled, completed, or altered by yet another change             order. For each purchase order line updated by a change order, the system updates the corresponding           project commitment on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form. For each           purchase order line created from a change order, the system creates a new project           commitment. In these commitments, the values are updated as follows: Revised Committed Quantity  =  Order                 Qty.  of the purchase order line Revised Committed Amount  =  Ext. Cost                of the purchase order line Committed CO Quantity  =  Revised Committed                 Quantity  –  Original Committed Quantity Committed CO Amount  =  Revised Committed                 Amount  –  Original Committed Amount Committed Open Amount  =  Open Amount  of               the purchase order line If the project has a cost budget line with the same project task, cost code or             inventory item, and account group as an updated or newly created commitment, the system             updates the cost budget line of the project on the  Cost Budget              tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Otherwise, the system creates a new             cost budget line for the project based on the commitment. Change Order Reversal After a change order has been released, it can no longer be changed and can only be         reversed on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form if you click            Reverse  action on the form toolbar. When the change order is         reversed, the system creates a new change order with lines that reverse the impact of the         original change order. In this reversing change order, the quantity and amount of a         commitment line cannot be greater than the  Received Qty.  and            Received Amount  of the corresponding purchase order line on the            Document Details  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders         (PO301000) form. A commitment line of this reversing change order also cannot reduce the            Order Qty.  of a purchase order line to zero. You may cancel the         purchase order line in this case. Change Order Classes Change order classes, which you can create on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM203000|PM203000]) Change Order Classes         (PM203000) form, make it possible to group change orders by their impact on projects and         by additional attributes that classes can have. You can also segregate changes by class in         reports to analyze, for example, which types of changes have the greatest impact on project         profitability. For instance, by using a change order class, you can create an internal         change order that does not affect the revenue budget of projects and is not assigned any         reference number within a project. This class of change orders will not have the            Revenue Budget  tab on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders         (PM308000) form. Change order classes also support the use of global attributes defined on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS205000|CS205000]) Attributes (CS205000) form. A list of attributes can be specified for a         change order class to be available in each change order belonging to the class. You can specify a default change order class in the  Default Change Order           Class  box on the  General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences (PM101000) form. The default change order class is then         assigned to each newly created document on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders form. Purchase Order Workflow with Change Orders Change orders can be created for the  Normal  type of purchase orders. The change order     workflow affects the standard purchase order life cycle as follows: If a normal purchase order has at least one line refers to a project with the change           order workflow enabled and the purchase order has no related change orders, the purchase           order can be modified directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders (PO301000) form. At           the same time, you can create a change order for such purchase order, if needed. The change order workflow is automatically enabled for a normal purchase order with at           least one line refers to a project with the change order workflow enabled if at least one           change order has been created for the purchase order. After the change order workflow has been enabled for a purchase order, the purchase           order cannot be removed or put on hold. After an existing purchase order with the  Open  status has been changed by means           of a change order and printing or emailing is required for the purchase order, the system           assigns to the purchase order the  Pending Printing  or  Pending Email  status,           respectively. A purchase order with the  Pending Printing  or  Pending Email  status cannot           be removed from the system if there is a change order that refers to this purchase           order. A purchase order with the  Open  status and with the change order workflow enabled           can be modified by means of change orders only. A purchase order with the  Open  status and with the change order workflow enabled           or an open line of this purchase order can be canceled or completed. A purchase order with the  Completed ,  Closed , or  Canceled  status can           be reopened by means of change orders. Such an order will be assigned the  Open ,              Pending Printing , or  Pending Email  status depending on the purchase order           workflow. A purchase order that originates from a change order cannot be edited or removed and can           be only printed, emailed, canceled, completed, or altered by yet another change           order. Ability to Control the Original Committed Values At the initial stage of a project, after the original commitments have been agreed on with         vendors and entered into the system, you can lock the commitments for the project, after         which all further amendments to the committed figures should be tracked as project changes         by change orders. The following commands in the  Actions  menu become         available on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form when the  Change           Orders  feature is enabled on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) Enable/Disable Features form and the            Internal Cost Commitment Tracking  check boxes is selected on the            General Settings  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM101000|PM101000]) Projects Preferences         (PM101000) form: This action appears on the form if . Lock Commitments : When this action is applied for a project, purchase           orders for this project cannot be created directly on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) Purchase Orders           (PO301000) form, existing purchase orders cannot be put on hold, and the commitments of           the project can be modified by means of change orders only. Unlock Commitments : This action gives users the ability to directly           enter purchase orders for the project. ]]></column>

Retainage is an amount held by a client until a contractor finishes work. Starting with 2019 R1, you can specify a retainage percent to be held by the client of a project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. The system will use this retainage percent to automatically calculate the retained amount for each invoice issued for the project.
==Default Retainage Percent==
You can specify a default retainage percent for a project template in the '''Retainage %''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_80_00|Project Templates] ([~/?ScreenId=PM208000|PM208000]) form. The specified value will be used by default for all projects based on this template. You can override the default value for each project (or specify a new value, if no default value was defined on the template level) in the '''Retainage %''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

When you select a customer for a new project, the system populates the '''Retainage %''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form with the '''Retainage Percent''' of the customer from the '''Retainage Settings''' section on the '''General Info''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. When you change the customer of the project, the system suggests updating the '''Retainage %''' with the retainage percentage of the selected customer.
==Retainage in Revenue Budget==
When you save your changes after specifying a retainage percent for a project, the system calculates the retainage amount for each revenue budget line of the project according to the specified percent. You can manually override the retainage percent for each revenue budget line on the '''Revenue Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

When you manually adjust the retainage percentage of a project in the '''Retainage (%)''' box in the '''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system suggests updating the retainage percentage of the revenue budget lines of the project.
==Retainage Tracking in Billing==
Retainage tracking is supported for both progress billing and time and material billing. For progress billing, the retainage percent for the lines of the invoice is copied directly from the corresponding revenue budget line and can be overridden. For time and material billing, the retainage percent is copied from the '''Retainage %''' box on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form and can be overridden.{br}

The system generates the AR invoice based on the pro forma invoice or project transactions, depending on the billing rules configured for the project. If draft invoice (pro forma) workflow is used, the retained amounts are copied from pro forma to the AR invoice once the latter is created, otherwise the retained amount is copied from a corresponding project transaction. The generated invoice with retainage is listed among other invoices for the project on the '''Invoices''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Also, on this tab, you can initiate release of the retainage of the invoice by clicking the row of the invoice in the table and then clicking the '''Release Retainage''' button on the table toolbar.
==Retainage in Commitments==
The following amounts of a commitment that originate from the purchase order line always include the retained amount on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form even if the corresponding purchase order line has the amount after retainage in the '''Amount''' column on the '''Document Details''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PO_30_10_00|Purchase Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PO301000|PO301000]) form:[anchor|#ul_hgb_znn_ldb]
*'''Original Committed Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.
*'''Committed Open Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Open Amount''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.
*'''Revised Committed Amount''': The amount originates from the '''Ext. Cost''' of the purchase order line that includes the retained amount.

The other commitment amounts are calculated based on the amounts listed above—that is, the commitment amounts include the retained amount if any.

In Acumatica ERP, you can create project budget forecasts and compare these forecasts with the actual project costs and incomes for each financial period.{br}

The functionality of project budget forecasts is available only if the ''Budget Forecast'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form.[anchor|#section_fdf_x42_p2b]
==Creation of the Project Budget Forecast==
You can create a project budget forecast on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form. You can forecast original and revised budget amounts and quantities for existing project budget lines for financial periods of the master calendar. Each project can have multiple revisions of the budget forecast. In a forecast revision, you can distribute the amounts and quantities of the project budget among the financial periods in the selected range to speed data entry. You can create generic inquiries and pivot tables that display forecast data.{br}

For a new project budget forecast, in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, you select the related project and enter an alphanumeric revision identifier of the budget forecast, which must be unique within the project. When you enter the revision, the system automatically fills in the table with the budget lines of the selected project.{br}

In the Summary area, you can also specify any of the following selection criteria to view in the table only the project budget lines with the selected settings:[anchor|#ul_fsf_yfs_p2b]
*'''Project Task''': The applicable project task of the selected project
*'''Type''': The account group type of the budget line, which is ''Expense'' by default
*'''Account Group''': The account group of the budget line
*'''Inventory ID''': The applicable stock or non-stock item
*'''Cost Code''': The applicable cost code; this box appears on the form only if the ''Cost Codes'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, you can also create a new revision of the project budget forecast as a copy of the selected revision by clicking '''Copy Revision''' on the form toolbar; you can then modify the created copy.[anchor|#section_xv2_f1w_mcb]
==Distribution of Budget Values for Forecast Periods==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form, you can add financial periods for project budget lines of the selected forecast revision in any of the following ways:[anchor|#_30f2fa21-7594-4792-9c85-d4c9d04548ac]
*Click the project budget line in the table, and on the table toolbar, click '''Add Periods'''. The system opens the '''Add Periods''' dialog box, where you can manually select the range of financial periods for the selected project budget line.
*On the form toolbar, click '''Generate Periods''' to automatically add financial periods for all the project budget lines that are listed in the table based on the selection criteria specified in the Summary area. For each line, the system adds periods in the range of periods that it selects as follows:
**As the starting financial period of the range, the system selects the earliest of the following periods, subject to the additional conditions specified:
***The financial period to which the '''Planned Start Date''' of the project task, which has been specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form, belongs.
***The financial period to which the first actual or change order amount of the project budget lines related to the project task was posted.
***The financial period to which the '''Start Date''' of the project task, which has been specified on the '''Tasks''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, belongs. This option is applicable only if no planned start date is found for the project task and no actual or change order amount has been posted for the project budget lines related to the project task.
***The financial period to which the '''Start Date''' of the project, which has been specified on the '''Summary''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, belongs. This option is applicable only if no start date is found for the project task.
**As the ending financial period of the range, the system selects the latest of the following periods:
***The financial period to which the '''Planned End Date''' of the project task, which has been specified on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form, belongs
***The financial period to which the last actual or change order amount of the budget line was posted

For the project budget lines, the system adds lines with quantities and amounts of zero for the periods.{br}

You can manually specify the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', '''Original Budgeted Amount''', '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''', and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' values for each period line of the project budget line.{br}

You can also distribute the quantities and amounts of project budget lines among period lines automatically. To do this, on the form toolbar, you click '''Distribute'''. In the '''Distribute''' dialog box, which is opened, you do the following:[anchor|#_7bc5bb69-9e69-4762-b0ab-cf3d5a4108b7]
*In the '''Value''' section, you select one of the following option buttons to define which values the system should distribute:
**'''Distribute Total''': The system distributes the values of the project budget line between all the period lines equally. All the values that have already been specified for the period lines will be overridden.
**'''Add Delta''': The system adds the delta, which is the difference between the values of the project budget line and the total values of the period lines, to all the period lines in proportion to the values that have been already specified for period lines.
*In the '''Columns''' section, you can select the check boxes corresponding to the columns in which the system should distribute values.
*In the '''Rows''' section, you specify whether the system should distribute values for all the project budget lines in the table or only for the project budget line you have selected in the table.

When you click '''OK''' in the dialog box, the system distributes the quantities and amounts of the listed project budget lines (which are those to which the system applied the selection criteria you specified in the Summary area) among period lines. The distribution function rounds equally distributed values using the built-in logarithmic rounding algorithm.{br}

For each project budget line, in the '''Original Budgeted Quantity''', '''Original Budgeted Amount''', '''Revised Budgeted Quantity''', and '''Revised Budgeted Amount''' columns, the system calculates the following values:[anchor|#_eb8115b3-a136-4595-93c5-02e6ce127d45]
*'''Total''': The total of the period lines
*'''Delta''': The difference between the value of the project budget line and the total of the period lines

==An Example of Rounding by the Distribution Function==
When the system automatically distributes the quantities and amounts of a project budget line among period lines, the {{DistibuteRound}} distribution function rounds equally distributed values using the built-in logarithmic rounding algorithm.{br}

The {{DistibuteRound(value, rowCount)}} function has the following values as the input parameters:[anchor|#_7b2da504-7bd5-4db4-a39d-7fdf291a5970]
*{{value}}: The quantity or amount of the project budget line to be distributed divided by the {{rowCount}}
*{{rowCount}}: The number of period lines to distribute the quantity or amount of the project budget line among

Rounding on a logarithmic scale is accomplished by taking the log of the amount and doing normal rounding to the nearest value on the log scale. Using the rounded value, which has been calculated, the system calculates the leftover for the last period line.{br}

The following example shows the way the system rounds a distributed amount.{br}

Suppose that the original budgeted amount to distribute is ''1,176.00''. The number of period lines to distribute the amount among is five. Thus, {{rowCount = 5}} and {{value = 1,176.00 / rowCount = 235.2}}{br}

The {{DistributeRound}} function rounds the {{value}} and returns {{240}}, which is the nearest number on the log scale. The leftover for the last period line is {{1,176.00 - ((rowCount - 1) * 240) = 216}}.{br}

Thus, the distribution function splits the original budgeted amount among five period lines as follows: [anchor|#_4c01e0e9-65d8-4089-910c-a561e6451310]
*''240.00'': Period lines from the first one to the fourth
*''216.00'': The last period line

==Integration Between Forecasts and Projects==
From the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form, you can navigate to the last modified revision of the project budget forecast on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] ([~/?ScreenId=PM209600|PM209600]) form by clicking '''Inquiries''' > '''Project Budget Forecast''' on the form toolbar. If the project has no budget forecast, a new budget forecast revision is created for the project.{br}

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, you can click any project budget line and then click '''Update Forecast Lines''' on the table toolbar to update the selected project budget line of the forecast revision. For this selected line, the system adds the financial periods to which actual values or change order values have been posted for the project budget line and that have been missed in the forecast revision.{br}

On the table toolbar of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_96_00|Project Budget Forecast] form, you can also click '''Update Project Budget''' to update the values of the project budget lines on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form with the corresponding delta values of the selected forecast revision. The original values of the project budget can be updated if the project budget is not locked. The revised values of the project budget can be updated if the change order workflow is disabled for the project. That is, if the '''Change Order Workflow''' check box is selected on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form.

With the ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature, you can track a project in the project currency, which can differ from the base currency. You can do the following:[anchor|#_53c525fe-9cfd-4942-ab5a-35077ea26f1e]
*Manage project budgets in the project currency
*Review actual revenues, actual costs, and committed costs in the project currency, with an ability to calculate project profitability in both the project currency and the base currency, and present costs to the customer in the customer&rsquo;s currency
*Track actual balances in the base currency at the historical exchange rate
*Track cost commitments in the project currency at the historical exchange rate
*Track change orders for budgeted amounts in the project currency
*Create change orders for commitments in a currency that differs from the base currency and the project currency
*Bill projects by using progress billing based on the revenue budget that is defined in the project currency
*Apply the exchange rates of the project currency to time and material transactions billed by quantity
*Add markup to billable amounts in the project currency during time and material billing
*Re-bill the exact amount of an expense in a foreign currency if the currency of the expense transaction is the same as the project currency in which the project is billed, which can be useful to re-bill travel expenses incurred during visits to the customer
*Plan budgets by financial period and create budget forecasts in the project currency to compare actual budgets and change order amounts with monthly budgets
*Create a project quote in a foreign currency and convert the quote to a project in this currency

The functionality of multi-currency project accounting is available only if the ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature is enabled on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CS_10_00_00|Enable/Disable Features] ([~/?ScreenId=CS100000|CS100000]) form. The ''Multi-Currency Projects'' feature can be enabled only if the ''Multi-Currency Accounting'' feature has been enabled.{br}{TOC}
==Configuration of Exchange Rates==
Projects in a foreign currency use currency exchange rates that are configured and maintained on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_30_10_00|Currency Rates] ([~/?ScreenId=CM301000|CM301000]) form. For more information on managing exchange rates, see [HelpRoot_Financials\CM__MNG_Managing_Currency_Rates|Managing Currency Rates].{br}

For multi-currency accounting in projects, as the default rate type, the system uses the rate type specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.[anchor|#section_fdf_x42_p2b]
==Projects with Multi-Currency Accounting==
Projects can have configurable currencies on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the project currency differs from the base currency, you can track the project in both the base currency and the project currency.{br}

For a new project created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system fills in the '''Project Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) with the customer&rsquo;s currency, which is selected in the '''Currency ID''' box on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. If the customer has no currency defined, the base currency is selected as the '''Project Currency'''. You can change the '''Project Currency''' if the project has no transactions, commitments, and change orders.{br}

The system selects the project currency in the '''Billing Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. This currency is used as the currency of the invoices created during the project billing. You can select any currency as the '''Billing Currency''' if the project currency is the base currency.{br}

The following table lists possible configurations for common business scenarios.[anchor|#_f9daa89e-499f-4a66-8fb3-eae1fc03f603]

The '''Currency Rate for Budget''' (in the Summary area) is the exchange rate that is used to display amounts in the project and base currencies on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. By default, this is the exchange rate of the rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section). If this box is cleared, which is the default value, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.{br}

You can click the exchange rate value in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. Then in the '''Rate Selection''' dialog box, which is opened, you can override the exchange rate for the project if the '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

By default, on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form, the system shows the amounts in the project currency. You can enter the amounts in the project currency only. If you click the '''View Base''' button in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area, the system shows the budgeted amounts and balances in the base currency converted based on the rate shown in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box. To show the amounts in the project currency, you click the '''View Cury''' button in the '''Currency Rate for Budget''' box in the Summary area.{br}

Only amounts in the '''Hist. Actual Amount in Base Currency''' column on the '''Revenue Budget''', '''Cost Budget''', and '''Balances''' tabs of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form are always shown in the base currency.
==Project Transactions with Multi-Currency Accounting==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) form, you can create project transactions with the amount in any foreign currency. The system converts the amount of these transactions in the project currency, which is specified in the '''Project Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

The '''Project Currency Rate''' of the project transaction is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.{br}

You enter the amount of the project transaction in the transaction currency. The system uses this amount in the transaction currency to calculate the transaction amounts in the project currency and in the base currency. The transaction amount in the base currency is not shown on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_40_00|Project Transactions] form. The system also updates the actual amounts of the project budget in the project currency and in the base currency with the corresponding amounts of the project transaction.{br}

When the system creates a project transaction based on a general ledger transaction, the amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the general ledger transaction to the project transaction. The corresponding amount in the project currency of the project transaction is calculated based on the amount in the transaction currency. (See the following diagram.)[anchor|#_660d9149-36ce-4111-9fec-df590787dd2f][anchor|#_0c192b0f-5f24-45b4-b656-db53ca11d985][image:UserGuide/Images/Project_Multi_Currency2.png|popup|A project transaction created based on a GL transaction|300px]
When the system creates a general ledger transaction based on a project transaction, the amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the project transaction to the general ledger transaction, as the following diagram illustrates.[anchor|#_d0b16557-a678-4ce0-8593-833dfda5306d][anchor|#_7dd2a10e-f98e-4cea-a7dd-9044c25868aa][image:UserGuide/Images/Project_Multi_Currency3.png|popup|A GL transaction created based on a project transaction|300px]
==Invoices for Projects with Multi-Currency Accounting==
During project billing, the system creates pro forma or accounts receivable invoices in the billing currency of the project specified in the '''Billing Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Billing and Allocation Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form.{br}

The exchange rate for the invoice is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ( '''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.{br}

You can override the exchange rate for an invoice if for the customer, the '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

All the invoice amounts can be reviewed in both the invoice currency and the base currency.
==Billing Process with Multi-Currency Accounting==
During the billing process, the system produces amounts in the project currency. Then the amounts are converted into the billing currency of the project.{br}

If the {{@Price}} parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, during the billing process with this billing rule, the system looks for the price in the project currency. If the price in the project currency is not found, the system converts the price from the base currency by using the exchange rate defined by the rate type of the project.{br}

If the {{@Rate}} parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] form, during the billing process with this billing rule, the system retrieves the rate as is for use in the user-defined formulas of the billing rule. On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] form, in formulas of time and material steps of a billing rule, you can convert an amount retrieved with the {{@Rate}} parameter by using the {{ConvertAmountToCurrency()}} function.{br}

The {{Report.ConvertAmountToCurrency(fromCuryID, toCuryID, rateType, effectiveDate, value)}} function has the following parameters:[anchor|#_8996a5fd-2fe8-4844-a643-507ac7ae8f12]
*{{fromCuryID}}: The source currency in which the {{@Rate}} has been defined
*{{toCuryID}}: The project currency
*{{rateType}}: The rate type of the project
*{{effectiveDate}}: The date on which the exchange rate is effective
*{{value}}: The amount to be converted

To re-bill an amount in the project currency as is, in the formula of a time and material step of a billing rule on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_20_70_00|Billing Rules] ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) form, you can use the following data field: {{[PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount]}}. {{PMTran.Amount}} is the amount in the base currency. {{PMTran.TranCuryAmount}} is the amount in the transaction currency. 
==Cost Commitments with Multi-Currency Accounting==
The system creates commitments for a project on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_60_00|Commitments] ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) form in the project currency.{br}

The exchange rate from the document currency to the project currency for the creation of the commitment is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the '''Currency Rate Type''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. If the project has no rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ( '''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form.
==Change Orders with Multi-Currency Accounting==
On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_80_00|Change Orders] ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) form, in the Summary area and on the '''Revenue Budget''' and '''Cost Budget''' tabs, amounts are shown in the project currency, which is specified in the '''Project Currency''' box on the '''Summary''' tab ('''Project Properties''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form. On the '''Commitments''' tab, amounts of change order lines are shown in the currency of the corresponding purchase orders.
==Project Quotes with Multi-Currency Accounting==
For a new project quote created on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_45_00|Project Quotes] ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) form, the system fills in the '''Currency''' box in the Summary area with the business account&rsquo;s currency selected in the '''Currency ID''' box on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) form. If no currency is defined for the customer, the base currency is selected as the project quote currency.{br}

If a project quote is created based on an opportunity selected on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_40_00|Opportunities] ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) form, the system selects the opportunity currency as the project quote currency.{br}

You can change the project quote currency if for the customer, the '''Enable Currency Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form. If you change the project quote currency and the project quote is the primary quote of an opportunity, the system changes the opportunity currency accordingly.{br}

For project quotes, the system uses the exchange rate of the default rate type of projects specified in the '''PM Rate Type''' box ('''Default Rate Types''' section) on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\CM_10_10_00|Currency Management Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) form. You can override the exchange rate for a project quote if for the customer, the '''Enable Rate Override''' check box is selected on the '''General Info''' tab ('''Financial Settings''' section) of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\AR_30_30_00|Customers] form.{br}

For the estimation lines of a project quote, the system converts the retrieved unit prices and unit costs of the selected inventory items to the project quote currency by using the exchange rate of the project quote.{br}

Although all the project quote amounts can be reviewed in both the project quote currency and the base currency, you can edit the amounts only in the project quote currency.{br}

When a project is created based on the project quote, the system copies to the project the project quote currency, the exchange rate of the project quote, and the price and cost information from the project quote in the project currency.

The  Multi-Currency Projects  feature can be enabled only if the            Multi-Currency Accounting  feature has been enabled. Configuration of Exchange Rates Projects in a foreign currency use currency exchange rates that are configured and         maintained on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM301000|CM301000]) Currency Rates (CM301000) form. For more         information on managing exchange rates, see  Managing Currency Rates. For multi-currency accounting in projects, as the default rate type, the system uses the         rate type specified in the  PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate           Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000)         form. Projects with Multi-Currency Accounting Projects can have configurable currencies on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. If the project currency differs from the base currency, you can track         the project in both the base currency and the project currency. For a new project created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the         system fills in the  Project Currency  box on the            Summary  tab ( Project Properties  section)         with the customer's currency, which is selected in the  Currency ID          box on the  General Info  tab ( Financial           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers         (AR303000) form. If the customer has no currency defined, the base currency is selected as         the  Project Currency . You can change the  Project           Currency  if the project has no transactions, commitments, and change         orders. The system selects the project currency in the  Billing Currency  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form.         This currency is used as the currency of the invoices created during the project billing.         You can select any currency as the  Billing Currency  if the project         currency is the base currency. The following table lists possible configurations for common business scenarios. Business Scenario Possible Configuration Base Currency Project Currency Billing Currency A company performs projects for local clients only. The project currency equals the base currency. All currencies are the                 same. USD USD USD A company performs projects for local clients but can occasionally have a                 project for a foreign client.

USD USD EUR A company performs projects for local and foreign clients. The project currency differs from the base currency. The billing currency                 always equals the project currency. USD EUR EUR only The  Currency Rate for Budget  (in the Summary area) is the exchange         rate that is used to display amounts in the project and base currencies on the            Revenue Budget ,  Cost Budget , and            Balances  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form. By default, this is the exchange rate of the rate type selected in the            Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section). If this box is cleared, which is the         default value, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the            PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate Types          section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. You can click the exchange rate value in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. Then in the  Rate           Selection  dialog box, which is opened, you can override the exchange rate for         the project if the  Enable Rate Override  check box is selected on the            General Info  tab ( Financial Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. By default, on the  Revenue Budget ,  Cost           Budget , and  Balances  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form, the system shows the amounts in the project         currency. You can enter the amounts in the project currency only. If you click the            View Base  button in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area, the system shows the budgeted amounts and         balances in the base currency converted based on the rate shown in the  Currency           Rate for Budget  box. To show the amounts in the project currency, you click         the  View Cury  button in the  Currency Rate for           Budget  box in the Summary area. Only amounts in the  Hist. Actual Amount in Base Currency  column on         the  Revenue Budget ,  Cost Budget , and            Balances  tabs of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         form are always shown in the base currency. Project Transactions with Multi-Currency Accounting On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions (PM304000) form, you can create project         transactions with the amount in any foreign currency. The system converts the amount of         these transactions in the project currency, which is specified in the  Project           Currency  box on the  Summary  tab ( Project           Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. The  Project Currency Rate  of the project transaction is defined by         the project-specific rate type selected in the  Currency Rate Type  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Project Properties          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. If the project has no         rate type selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the            PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate Types          section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. You enter the amount of the project transaction in the transaction currency. The system         uses this amount in the transaction currency to calculate the transaction amounts in the         project currency and in the base currency. The transaction amount in the base currency is         not shown on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304000|PM304000]) Project Transactions form. The system also updates         the actual amounts of the project budget in the project currency and in the base currency         with the corresponding amounts of the project transaction. When the system creates a project transaction based on a general ledger transaction, the         amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the         general ledger transaction to the project transaction. The corresponding amount in the         project currency of the project transaction is calculated based on the amount in the         transaction currency. (See the following diagram.) A project transaction created based on a GL transaction When the system creates a general ledger transaction based on a project transaction, the         amount in the transaction currency and the amount in the base currency are copied from the         project transaction to the general ledger transaction, as the following diagram         illustrates. A GL transaction created based on a project transaction Invoices for Projects with Multi-Currency Accounting During project billing, the system creates pro forma or accounts receivable invoices in the         billing currency of the project specified in the  Billing Currency  box         on the  Summary  tab ( Billing and Allocation           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects         (PM301000) form. The exchange rate for the invoice is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in         the  Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects form. If the project has no rate type selected, the         system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the  PM Rate           Type  box (  Default Rate Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. You can override the exchange rate for an invoice if for the customer, the            Enable Rate Override  check box is selected on the            General Info  tab ( Financial Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. All the invoice amounts can be reviewed in both the invoice currency and the base         currency. Billing Process with Multi-Currency Accounting During the billing process, the system produces amounts in the project currency. Then the         amounts are converted into the billing currency of the project. If the  @Price  parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing         rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form, during the billing         process with this billing rule, the system looks for the price in the project currency. If         the price in the project currency is not found, the system converts the price from the base         currency by using the exchange rate defined by the rate type of the project. If the  @Rate  parameter is used in a time and material step of a billing         rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules form, during the billing process         with this billing rule, the system retrieves the rate as is for use in the user-defined         formulas of the billing rule. On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules form, in         formulas of time and material steps of a billing rule, you can convert an amount retrieved         with the  @Rate  parameter by using the            ConvertAmountToCurrency()  function. The  Report.ConvertAmountToCurrency(fromCuryID, toCuryID, rateType, effectiveDate,           value)  function has the following parameters: fromCuryID : The source currency in which the  @Rate  has           been defined toCuryID : The project currency rateType : The rate type of the project effectiveDate : The date on which the exchange rate is effective value : The amount to be converted To re-bill an amount in the project currency as is, in the formula of a time and material         step of a billing rule on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM207000|PM207000]) Billing Rules (PM207000) form,         you can use the following data field:  [PMTran.ProjectCuryAmount] .            PMTran.Amount  is the amount in the base currency.            PMTran.TranCuryAmount  is the amount in the transaction currency.  Cost Commitments with Multi-Currency Accounting The system creates commitments for a project on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM306000|PM306000]) Commitments (PM306000) form in the project currency. The exchange rate from the document currency to the project currency for the creation of         the commitment is defined by the project-specific rate type selected in the            Currency Rate Type  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. If the project has no rate type         selected, the system uses the default rate type of projects specified in the  PM           Rate Type  box (  Default Rate Types  section) on the             ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000) form. Change Orders with Multi-Currency Accounting On the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM308000|PM308000]) Change Orders (PM308000) form, in the Summary area         and on the  Revenue Budget  and  Cost Budget          tabs, amounts are shown in the project currency, which is specified in the            Project Currency  box on the  Summary  tab           ( Project Properties  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects (PM301000) form. On the            Commitments  tab, amounts of change order lines are shown in the         currency of the corresponding purchase orders. Project Quotes with Multi-Currency Accounting For a new project quote created on the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM304500|PM304500]) Project Quotes         (PM304500) form, the system fills in the  Currency  box in the Summary         area with the business account's currency selected in the  Currency ID          box on the  General Info  tab ( Financial           Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers         (AR303000) form. If no currency is defined for the customer, the base currency is selected         as the project quote currency. If a project quote is created based on an opportunity selected on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CR304000|CR304000]) Opportunities (CR304000) form, the system selects the opportunity         currency as the project quote currency. You can change the project quote currency if for the customer, the  Enable           Currency Override  check box is selected on the  General           Info  tab ( Financial Settings  section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. If you change the project quote currency and         the project quote is the primary quote of an opportunity, the system changes the opportunity         currency accordingly. For project quotes, the system uses the exchange rate of the default rate type of projects         specified in the  PM Rate Type  box ( Default Rate           Types  section) on the   ([~/?ScreenId=CM101000|CM101000]) Currency Management Preferences (CM101000)         form. You can override the exchange rate for a project quote if for the customer, the            Enable Rate Override  check box is selected on the            General Info  tab ( Financial Settings          section) of the   ([~/?ScreenId=AR303000|AR303000]) Customers form. For the estimation lines of a project quote, the system converts the retrieved unit prices         and unit costs of the selected inventory items to the project quote currency by using the         exchange rate of the project quote. Although all the project quote amounts can be reviewed in both the project quote currency         and the base currency, you can edit the amounts only in the project quote currency. When a project is created based on the project quote, the system copies to the project the         project quote currency, the exchange rate of the project quote, and the price and cost         information from the project quote in the project currency. ]]></column>

A project budget is an estimate of expenses or revenues for a project or project task. In Acumatica ERP, a budget can be defined, updated, and tracked for only a project task; the budget for a project holds the totals for all the project tasks included in the project.{br}{TOC}
==Budget Planning==
You plan a project budget during the planning stage of the project, before any project transaction occurs. (For information about the project life cycle, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Project_Life_Cycle|Project Life Cycle].){br}

On the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form, you can add, revise, and delete budget lines for any project task that has the ''In Planning'' status. A project task can have multiple budget lines. Each budget line has the following:[anchor|#ul_hpn_njy_mv]
*An account group, which determines the category of the expenditure or revenue that you expect to incur during the project execution.
*A particular inventory item (that is, a resource) needed to complete the task. You can select an inventory item from the list of inventory items associated with the accounts of the specified account group. However, if you want the budget line to include the budget for all transactions associated with the selected account group that are not linked to any particular inventory item, you can select ''&lt;OTHER&gt;'' in the '''Inventory ID''' column for the particular budget line. 

Other information that you can specify in a budget line includes the budgeted quantity of the selected inventory item, the rate, and the total budgeted amount, which is calculated automatically as the budgeted quantity multiplied by rate if you haven&rsquo;t specified a value manually.{br}

You can modify the data in a budget line until you change the status of the project task to ''Active''; after that, you can specify only a revised amount and quantity in the budget line.((({S:Hint}The system allows the modification of original budgeted totals for tasks with all statuses (not just ''In Planning''), so you need to be careful about how you manage project budgets. (For instance, you may want to restrict access to the project budget data by configuring a restriction group in the Row-Level Security module so that only authorized employees can modify budget lines; for more information about restriction groups, see [HelpRoot_Administration\RS__mng_Managing_Restriction_groups|Managing Visibility with Restriction Groups].)
)))
In Acumatica ERP, you can also use other forms, in addition to the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form, to enter, track, or revise a project budget. The forms, which include the same budget data but a different level of detail, include the following:[anchor|#ul_xkt_wpb_3v]
*[HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) form: On the '''Balances''' tab of this form, the most general information about project budgets is displayed. The information, which contains the details of all the project-related tasks regardless of their status, is broken down into budget lines by account group.
*:On this tab, you can view only the original budgeted amounts, the revised budgets, and the actual budgets calculated based on the project-related transactions that involve the specified account group; you cannot add, delete, or modify budget lines by using this form. 

On the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] and [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] forms, you can use the '''Auto-Budget''' action to automatically calculate an estimate of future revenue that will be added as a separate budget line for an account group with the ''Income'' type. For the calculation to be accurate, the project budget for the expenses, the involved account groups, and the allocation rules must be properly configured.((({S:Hint}If you want to track the costs of the budget planning activities, you can add an employee task to the related project or project task by using the '''Activity History''' tab on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form, respectively. However, transactions generated for a completed task cannot be released until the project gets the ''Active'' status.
)))
In some cases (for instance, if project data has been modified through external tools or import scenarios), you may need to recalculate the project balances to bring them in line with the underlying transactions. You use the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_50_40_00|Validate Project Balances] ([~/?ScreenId=PM504000|PM504000]) form for recalculating the balances for the selected projects.
==Budget Tracking==
For each active project or project task, you can review the budget at any time and decide whether you need to revise it or to adjust expenditures.{br}

For tracking a budget, you can use any of the following forms, depending on the level of detail at which you want to view the budget information: [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_10_00|Projects] ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]). Also, you can run the [HelpRoot_ReportReference\PM_62_10_00|Project Balance] ([~/?ScreenId=PM621000|PM621000]) report, which shows the balances of all projects that are active during the selected financial period.{br}

In Acumatica ERP, account groups are used for aggregation of the information related to project budgets. An account group includes General Ledger accounts of a particular type to which project-related transactions are posted. As the project progresses, actual amounts are calculated for each budget line based on the posted transactions; you can track the actual amounts and compare them to the budgeted amounts when reviewing the budget. (For more information about account groups, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Account_Groups|Account Groups in Projects].)((({S:Hint}Because there is no way to assign an AP bill line for a landed cost to any project task, the purchase price variance amount calculated as the difference between the landed cost specified in the purchase receipt and the landed cost specified in the AP bill is not reflected in the project expenses.
)))
Also, you can track the actual quantities of the inventory items included in the budget. An actual quantity is calculated automatically if the following conditions are met:[anchor|#ul_ocb_2qz_lv]
*The budget was specified for the project or project task before any project-related transaction occurred.
*Units of measure were specified for the inventory items before the project was activated.
*The same unit of measure is used for all inventory items that were used in the transactions posted to the accounts included in a particular account group.
*The transactions have been released and posted.

For examples of how the system calculates actual quantities, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Actual_Quantity|Actual Quantity: Calculation Examples].
==Budget Revision==
In some cases (for instance, if you have specified an incorrect value in a budget line or if the project scope has changed), you may want to revise the budget. The original budgeted amounts and quantities should always remain unchanged so that you can later analyze the accuracy of your original estimates. You enter a revised amount or revised quantity for each budget line in a separate column labeled '''Revised Amount''' or '''Revised Qty'''.{br}

The actual progress of the task, which is displayed in the '''Performance''' column on the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form, is calculated as a ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the actual amount to the revised budget amount. Also, the system uses the revised values for calculation of the task completion percentage if ''Budgeted Quantity'' or ''Budgeted Amount'' is selected for the task in the '''Completion Calculation Method''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form. (For more information about how the task completion percentage is calculated, see [HelpRoot_Projects\PM__con_Task_Completion|Calculation of Task Completion Percentage].)

Budget Tracking For each active project or project task, you can review the budget at any time and decide     whether you need to revise it or to adjust expenditures. For tracking a budget, you can use any of the following forms, depending on the level of     detail at which you want to view the budget information:   ([~/?ScreenId=PM301000|PM301000]) Projects     (PM301000), or   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000).

In  Acumatica ERP,     account groups are used for aggregation of the information related to project budgets. An     account group includes General Ledger accounts of a particular type to which project-related     transactions are posted. As the project progresses, actual amounts are calculated for each     budget line based on the posted transactions; you can track the actual amounts and compare them     to the budgeted amounts when reviewing the budget. (For more information about account groups,     see  Account Groups in Projects.) Because there is no way to assign an AP bill line for a landed cost to any project task,     the purchase price variance amount calculated as the difference between the landed cost     specified in the purchase receipt and the landed cost specified in the AP bill is not reflected     in the project expenses. Also, you can track the actual quantities of the inventory items included in the budget. An     actual quantity is calculated automatically if the following conditions are met: The budget was specified for the project or project task before any project-related      transaction occurred. Units of measure were specified for the inventory items before the project was      activated. The same unit of measure is used for all inventory items that were used in the transactions      posted to the accounts included in a particular account group. The transactions have been released and posted. For examples of how the system calculates actual quantities, see  Actual Quantity: Calculation Examples. Budget Revision In some cases (for instance, if you have specified an incorrect value in a budget line or if     the project scope has changed), you may want to revise the budget. The original budgeted amounts     and quantities should always remain unchanged so that you can later analyze the accuracy of your     original estimates. You enter a revised amount or revised quantity for each budget line in a     separate column labeled  Revised Amount  or  Revised      Qty . The actual progress of the task, which is displayed in the  Performance      column on the  Budget  tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks form, is     calculated as a ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the actual amount to the revised budget     amount. Also, the system uses the revised values for calculation of the task completion     percentage if  Budgeted Quantity  or  Budgeted Amount  is selected for the task in the       Completion Calculation Method  box on the  General Settings  tab of     the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks form.

Whether and how the system calculates an actual quantity for a budget line depends on the completeness and consistency of the information that is specified for the particular budget line and in the transactions posted to the accounts of the particular account group. Thus, the calculated actual quantity may appear confusing to the user; the task completion percentage may also seem confusing if ''Budgeted Quantity'' is selected for the task in the '''Completion Calculation Method''' box on the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. The sections below include the most common examples of the ways an actual quantity may be calculated in Acumatica ERP.{br}{TOC}
==Scenario 1: Budget Lines and Related Transactions Have Matching Units of Measure==
Suppose that you are managing a large project of building a house, and this project includes a task of installing a ventilation system. For this task, 40 hours of regular labor and 10 hours of overtime labor are budgeted. The budget lines specified for the task on the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form include the following settings.[anchor|#table_kpq_pcm_mv]

==Scenario 2: No Unit of Measure Is Specified in the Budget Line==
Suppose that you have a project task for a business trip. An employee may incur various expenses during a business trip, such as transportation charges and accommodation expenses. You have budgeted all these expenses by specifying a total budgeted amount, but without specifying any particular inventory items or units of measure. The budget line specified for the task on the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form includes the following information.[anchor|#table_ump_g5n_mv]

During the business trip, the employee spent three nights in a hotel, had three business lunches, and had a return flight. The involved inventory items have different units of measure. As a result, transactions that include the following settings, which you can review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transactions] form, are generated as the project is billed.[anchor|#table_zqt_1wn_mv]

The system doesn&rsquo;t calculate the actual quantity on the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] form because no unit of measure is specified for the budget line. However, ''1950'' is displayed in the '''Actual Amount''' column, which is the total of all travel expenses regardless of their units of measure.
==Scenario 3: Different Units of Measure Are Specified==
This scenario is similar to the previous scenario, except that a particular unit of measure is specified for the budget line on the '''Budget''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_30_20_00|Project Tasks] ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) form. The budget line includes the following settings.[anchor|#table_j2v_z14_mv]

The resulting transactions (whose settings, which you can review on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\PM_40_10_00|Project Transactions] form, are shown in the table below) are identical to those in the previous scenario, but the system calculates the actual quantity for the budget line as the sum of all the quantities for the inventory items with the ''EACH'' unit of measure. Note that the actual amount is calculated as the total of all travel expenses regardless of their units of measure.[anchor|#table_prv_rb4_mv]

The actual quantity is calculated this way because the system cannot combine different units of measure, such as days, miles and currency amounts, into a single line.]]></column>
			<column name="PlainText"><![CDATA[Actual Quantity: Calculation Examples Whether and how the system calculates an actual quantity for a budget line depends on the         completeness and consistency of the information that is specified for the particular budget         line and in the transactions posted to the accounts of the particular account group. Thus,         the calculated actual quantity may appear confusing to the user; the task completion         percentage may also seem confusing if  Budgeted Quantity  is selected for the task in         the  Completion Calculation Method  box on the  General Settings          tab of the   ([~/?ScreenId=PM302000|PM302000]) Project Tasks (PM302000) form. The sections below include         the most common examples of the ways an actual quantity may be calculated in  Acumatica ERP. Scenario 1: Budget Lines and Related Transactions Have Matching Units of         Measure Suppose that you are managing a large project of building a house, and this project         includes a task of installing a ventilation system.

In Acumatica ERP, integration with human resource management (HRM) and payroll systems is available through the contract-based API. This can give you the following capabilities:[anchor|#ul_fdn_hcf_z2b]
*Integration with a construction-specific payroll system, including the ability to upload projects, project tasks, and cost codes from Acumatica ERP, which serves as the primary source of the project data
*Support of standard labor costs for projects along with actual labor costs, which are calculated and received from a construction-specific payroll system
*The proper calculation of union wages and prevailing wages in a construction-specific payroll system, which is possible due to users specifying additional settings when they enter employee time in Acumatica ERP
*The importing of employee time from a construction-specific payroll system to Acumatica ERP as time entries to be used for labor cost accounting in projects

==Basic Integration Scenario==
A basic scenario for integration between Acumatica ERP 2019 R1 and a payroll system involves the following steps:[anchor|#ol_gdn_hcf_z2b]
#An employee logs his or her activity in Acumatica ERP by creating time entries on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_70_00|Employee Time Activities] ([~/?ScreenId=EP307000|EP307000]), [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_30_50_00|Employee Time Card] ([~/?ScreenId=EP305000|EP305000]), or [HelpRoot_FormReference\CR_30_60_10|Activity] ([~/?ScreenId=CR306010|CR306010]) form.
#After the time entries have been approved (if applicable) and released, they are exported to an external payroll system, where they can be processed further.
#When the entries have been processed in the external payroll system, the GL transactions created based on the entries are imported to Acumatica ERP.
#When the GL transactions have been verified in Acumatica ERP, the transactions are released and posted to the general ledger.

The following options can be used for the implementation of the integration:[anchor|#ul_idn_hcf_z2b]
*An option to not post any project transactions on release of time activities. To use this option, you select ''Do not Post'' as the '''Posting Option''' in the '''Time Reporting Settings''' section of the '''General Settings''' tab of the [HelpRoot_FormReference\EP_10_10_00|Time and Expenses Preferences] ([~/?ScreenId=EP101000|EP101000]) form.
*An option to not create project transactions on release of general ledger transactions with the specified project. For more information, see [HelpRoot_Dev_Integration\IS__con_Import_of_GL_Transactions|Creation of a General Ledger Transaction with a Project Code That Does Not Produce a Project Transaction].

==Interfaces for Integration==
To integrate an external payroll system with Acumatica ERP, you can use the following endpoints, which are defined on the [HelpRoot_FormReference\SM_20_70_60|Web Service Endpoints] ([~/?ScreenId=SM207060|SM207060]) form, to access web services:[anchor|#ul_hdn_hcf_z2b]
*The ''TimeEntry'' endpoint of the ''18.200.001'' version for employee time entries
*The ''JournalTransaction'' endpoint of the ''18.200.001'' version for general ledger transactions
*The ''LaborCostRate'' endpoint of the ''18.200.001'' version for standard labor cost rates
*The ''Default'' endpoint of the ''18.200.001'' version for the remaining entities
