NetSuite and Intacct are harder to use, and have immature feature sets compared to on-premise competitors. For example they have some multi-currency, but do not support financial statement translation or VAT taxes. <br><br>We are designing our product so it will be a no compromises alternative from a feature, usability and performance perspective compared to on-premise products, yet also have the great advantages offered by on-demand - ane where we think we can deliver some cool innovations. <br><br><i>We think this is pretty exciting stuff; no one has achieved this - please stay tunedâ€¦</i> <br><br>Sincerely, <br>The Acumatica Team."></asp:Label>
